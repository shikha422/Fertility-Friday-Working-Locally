The research followed over 500 couples trying to conceive and found that women with low urinary iodine levels were significantly less likely to conceive per cycle. Lisa unpacks the study design, outcomes, and implications, highlighting how iodine status may influence reproductive function. She also discusses iodine’s role beyond thyroid health, including its concentration in breast and ovarian tissue. With nearly half of the participants showing some level of deficiency, the study raises important questions about iodine’s relevance for women of reproductive age. This episode offers a closer look at one of the most debated nutrients in fertility and hormone health.\nKey Topics Covered: Understanding Iodine’s Role in Fertility\nThe featured research study examining iodine deficiency and delayed conception\nHow urinary iodine concentrations were used to assess iodine status in women trying to conceive\nStudy findings linking low iodine levels to reduced chances of conception per cycle\nPrevalence of iodine deficiency among women of reproductive age in population studies\nIodine’s role beyond thyroid hormone production, including broader hormonal function\nThe concentration of iodine in breast and ovarian tissue and its relevance to reproductive health\nWhy iodine remains one of the most controversial nutrients in women’s health discussions\nListener Takeaways for Practitioners Supporting Clients with Preconception Care\nIodine deficiency was associated with a longer time to pregnancy in a large cohort of couples actively trying to conceive.\nThe study measured iodine status using urinary iodine concentrations, which are commonly used in population-level research.\nWomen with low iodine levels were found to be significantly less likely to conceive per menstrual cycle compared to those with sufficient levels.\nA substantial proportion of women of reproductive age in the study showed mild to severe iodine deficiency, reflecting broader population trends.\nIodine plays roles beyond thyroid hormone production, including involvement in overall hormone function and reproductive tissues.\nThe episode highlights why iodine remains a debated nutrient in women’s health, particularly in the context of fertility and thyroid-related discussions.\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nTimestamped Breakdown: Iodine Research and Reproductive Health\nWhy is iodine such a controversial nutrient in fertility care?

    "main_text": "Does Skipping Breakfast Count As Intermittent Fasting?\nIntermittent fasting is a trending nutrition strategy—but many women unknowingly compromise their hormonal health by skipping breakfast. In this episode, Lisa explores how breakfast impacts ovulation, energy levels, progesterone production, and overall cycle health. Drawing on research highlighted in Real Food for Fertility, she discusses why a strategic eating window—with sufficient calories and macronutrients—is critical for fertility optimization, especially for active women or those TTC.\nTimestamps\n00:00 – Chart interpretation struggles & the real reason you’re undernourished\n04:30 – Study overview: breakfast, energy intake & physical activity\n10:15 – Skipping breakfast = accidental under-eating?\n15:45 – Macronutrient losses: lower protein and carbs in breakfast skippers\n20:30 – How meal timing affects cycle length, mucus & luteal phase health\n25:00 – Intermittent fasting done right: Lisa’s clinical recommendations\n30:45 – Coffee, hunger suppression, and menstrual cycle disruption\nKey Takeaways\nSkipping breakfast often leads to a 20–25% drop in total daily caloric intake—without compensatory eating later in the day.\nWomen who skip breakfast tend to consume significantly less protein and carbohydrates overall, impacting hormone production.\nUnder-eating—even unintentionally—reduces estrogen and progesterone levels, disrupting ovulation and the luteal phase.\nStrategic intermittent fasting can be cycle-safe when using a 10-hour eating window with three complete meals.\nFertility-focused nutrition must consider macronutrient adequacy, timing, and the body’s physiological needs—not trends.\nResources and Mentions\nSkipping breakfast reduces energy intake and physical activity in healthy women who are habitual breakfast eaters- A randomized crossover trial.\nReal Food for Fertility | Lisa Hendrickson-Jack and Lily Nichols\nThe Fifth Vital Sign: Master Your Cycles & Optimize Your Fertility (Book) | Lisa Hendrickson-Jack\nFertility Awareness Mastery Charting Workbook\nFertility Awareness Mastery Online Self-Study Program\nRelated Podcast Episodes\n[FAMM Practitioner Series] FFP 481 | Exercise, Undereating & The Menstrual Cycle | Haley Smith\nFFP 459 | Exercise, Under-Eating & Your Hormones | FAMM Research Series | Lisa | Fertility Friday\nFFP 370 | Eat More, Exercise Less, and Loose Weight? | A Women-Centred Approach To Weight Loss | Kitty Blomfield\nDisclaimer\nThis podcast episode is provided for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

This episode explores the critical role of nutrition in fertility, using PCOS as a case study to explain why protein intake, blood sugar regulation, and macronutrient balance are essential for hormonal health, ovulation, and conception. Together, Lisa and Lily unpack current research, challenge common dietary myths, and explain how evidence-based nutrition supports both menstrual cycle health and pregnancy preparation.\nKey Topics Covered:\nWhy protein intake matters for fertility and hormone balance\nPCOS as a case study for metabolic health\nInsulin resistance and ovulatory dysfunction\nBlood sugar balance and menstrual cycle regularity\nHigh-protein and lower-carb dietary approaches\nWhy calorie restriction disrupts hormones\nThe myth of minimum carbohydrate requirements\nPreparing the body nutritionally for conception\nListener Takeaways:\nMany women consistently under-eat protein\nProtein supports blood sugar stability and ovulation\nInsulin resistance plays a central role in PCOS\nImproving metabolism often improves cycle regularity\nWeight loss is not the primary goal for fertility support\nLow-calorie and low-fat diets can suppress hormones\nAdequate protein and fat help regulate cycles naturally\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nWhy Nutrition Matters for Fertility ( 00:00 – 06:00 )\nLisa introduces the episode and explains why nutrition deserves more attention in fertility conversations. Lily shares why protein intake affects satiety, blood sugar, and hormone production, even before pregnancy is part of the picture.\nProtein Intake and PCOS ( 06:00 – 18:00 )\nLily explains how higher-protein dietary approaches consistently show better outcomes in PCOS studies. She breaks down how protein supports blood sugar balance and why many successful PCOS interventions include higher protein and lower carbohydrate ratios.\nInsulin Resistance and Ovulation ( 18:00 – 28:00 )\nShe outlines the study’s long duration, describing how participants were divided into control and intervention groups and instructed to significantly reduce dietary fat intake.\nThe Plate Method and Macronutrient Balance ( 28:00 – 38:00 )\nLily shares a practical way to structure meals by shifting the plate away from carb-heavy meals and toward adequate protein, fat, and vegetables. This approach improves blood sugar control without extreme restriction.\nWhy Weight Loss Is Not the Goal ( 38:00 – 48:00 )\nLisa and Lily discuss why focusing solely on weight loss often misses the root cause of fertility issues. Improving metabolic health, nutrient intake, and hormone balance leads to better outcomes than calorie restriction alone.\nCarbohydrate Myths and Hormone Health ( 48:00 – 58:00 )\nLily addresses the claim that women need a minimum amount of carbohydrates to ovulate. She explains that the research behind this idea actually studied low-calorie diets, not low-carb diets, and why adequate energy intake matters more than carb quantity alone.\nBlood Sugar Balance for Everyone ( 58:00 – 66:00 )\nThe discussion expands beyond PCOS, explaining why blood sugar regulation matters for all women trying to conceive. Even mild blood sugar elevations can delay conception and affect pregnancy outcomes.\nReal Food for Fertility Overview ( 66:00 – 74:00 )\nLily summarizes the book’s approach, focusing on nutrient-dense foods, balanced macronutrients, and preparing the body for pregnancy rather than entering conception depleted.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources Mentioned\nReal Food for Pregnancy\nReal Food for Gestational Diabetes\nReal Food for Fertility\nThe Fifth Vital Sign: Master Your Cycles & Optimize Your Fertility (Book) | Lisa Hendrickson-Jack\nFertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship (FAMM) — Now enrolling\nRelated Podcast Episodes\nFFP 561 | Boost Fertility And Balance Hormones By Doing This! | Real Food For Fertility | Lily Nichols RDN\nFFP 517 | Optimizing Egg Quality | Real Food for Fertility\n{NEW BOOK} FFP 508 | Real Food for Fertility | Behind the Scenes with Lily Nichols & Lisa Hendrickson-Jack\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.

Drawing from research-focused episodes, clinical experience, and practitioner work inside the Fertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship, Lisa shares her top 10 takeaways from the year. These insights highlight recurring themes around cycle literacy, ovulation, cervical mucus, hormonal birth control, male fertility, under-fueling, perimenopause, and why symptoms are meaningful signals—not random inconveniences.\nKey Topics Covered:\nWhy the menstrual cycle is the most powerful personalized diagnostic tool\nCervical mucus vs. apps, algorithms, and AI predictions\nThe foundational role of ovulation in long-term health\nHormonal birth control and its measurable effects on hormones and sexual health\nUnder-eating, stress, and overtraining as drivers of cycle disruption\nTiming and its critical role in conception\nMale fertility is half of the fertility equation\nCycle literacy as a missing skill in women’s healthcare\nPerimenopause as a transition, not a disease\nSymptoms are meaningful feedback from the body\nListener Takeaways:\nCharting your menstrual cycle provides real-time, individualized health data that no app can replace.\nOvulation is essential for bone, metabolic, cardiovascular, and hormone health—not just fertility.\nCervical mucus remains the most accurate indicator of fertility, even in a tech-driven world.\nHormonal birth control has wide-ranging effects on libido, nutrients, mood, and fertility that deserve open discussion.\nUnderstanding your cycle helps you cut through health noise and make decisions based on your body’s actual response.\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nPodcast Milestones & Year-End Reflection ( 00:00 – 04:30 )\nLisa reflects on Fertility Friday’s 11th anniversary, over 600 episodes, and more than five million downloads. She explains why the end of the year is a natural point for reviewing themes, research, and lessons from the 2025 podcast season.\nTakeaway #1: The Menstrual Cycle as a Diagnostic Tool ( 04:30 – 09:30 )\nLisa explains why the menstrual cycle provides unmatched personalized health data. She shares how charting reveals issues like PMS, spotting, pain, and irregular cycles that often go unaddressed in conventional healthcare.\nTakeaway #2: Cervical Mucus Beats Apps and Algorithms ( 09:30 – 13:30 )\nDespite advances in AI and fertility apps, Lisa emphasizes that real-time observations of cervical mucus remain more accurate. Apps cannot detect biological signs happening in the body, making foundational knowledge essential.\nTakeaway #3: Ovulation Is Not Optional ( 13:30 – 17:30 )\nOvulation is framed as foundational to lifelong health, not just reproduction. Lisa discusses how ovulatory hormones support metabolism, mood, bone density, and cardiovascular health.\nTakeaway #4: Hormonal Birth Control and the Pushback ( 17:30 – 23:00 )\nLisa reviews growing research on hormonal contraceptives and their effects on libido, vulvar tissues, nutrients, and fertility. She also discusses increasing resistance from medical and tech institutions as women ask more informed questions.\nTakeaway #5: Under-Fueling, Stress, and Overtraining ( 23:00 – 27:30 )\nCharting often reveals subtle cycle disruptions caused by undereating and excessive exercise. Lisa explains how delayed ovulation, short luteal phases, and low temperatures expose hidden energy deficits.\nTakeaway #6: Timing Still Matters for Conception ( 27:30 – 31:30 )\nLisa stresses that accurate timing during the fertile window is essential. Many couples struggle to conceive simply because intercourse is mistimed—something charting quickly clarifies.\nTakeaway #7: Male Fertility Is Half the Equation ( 31:30 – 35:30 )\nLisa highlights research linking sperm quality to conception success and miscarriage risk. She explains why male fertility must be evaluated when pregnancy doesn’t occur despite correct timing.\nTakeaway #8: Cycle Literacy Is Missing in Healthcare ( 35:30 – 40:00 )\nLisa shares real-world examples of how lack of cycle knowledge leads to misdiagnosis and ineffective treatment.

    "main_text": "Podcast Host:\nLisa Hendrickson-Jack is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience. As the host of the Fertility Friday Podcast and author of The Fifth Vital Sign, Lisa is known for translating complex research into practical insights that help women make informed decisions about hormonal health, fertility, and birth control.\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nEpisode Overview:\nIn this research-focused episode, Lisa dives into one of the most controversial studies ever discussed on the podcast: the study examining clitoral vascularization, clitoral volume, and sexual function in women using hormonal contraceptives. This episode breaks down what the study actually measured, why its findings sparked backlash, and why, despite a small sample size,e it raises serious questions about informed consent, sexual side effects, and the lack of follow-up research on hormonal birth control.\nKey Topics Covered:\nWhy the clitoral shrinkage study became so controversial\nHow hormonal contraceptives affect testosterone, SHBG, and sexual function\nDifferences between the pill and the vaginal ring\nMeasured changes in clitoral volume and blood flow\nSexual side effects, including libido, lubrication, orgasm, and pain\nWhy the study has never been replicated\nInformed consent and the ethics of contraceptive research\nWhether these effects are permanent or reversible\nListener Takeaways:\nHormonal contraceptives can cause measurable, physical changes to sexual tissues, not just subjective symptoms.\nBoth the pill and the vaginal ring were associated with reduced clitoral volume after six months of use.\nSexual side effects like low libido and painful sex are supported by physiological data, not imagination.\nA small sample size does not invalidate clinically significant findings, especially when effects are consistent.\nWomen deserve full, transparent information to make informed decisions about birth control use.\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nIntroduction & Why This Study Matters ( 00:00 – 03:00 )\nLisa introduces the episode and explains why this study generated intense backlash when she first shared it publicly. She frames the discussion around informed consent and the responsibility to share uncomfortable research findings.\nBackground: Hormonal Birth Control and Sexual Function ( 03:00 – 08:00 )\nLisa reviews existing research linking hormonal contraceptives to reduced libido, orgasm changes, and pain with sex. She explains how suppression of ovulation affects estrogen, progesterone, and especially testosterone.\nStudy Design: What Did Researchers Measure? ( 08:00 – 14:30 )\nThe study followed 40 naturally cycling women aged 18–35, measuring clitoral volume, blood flow, hormones, and sexual function before and after six months on either the pill or the vaginal ring. Strict protocols were used to ensure accurate measurements.\nKey Findings: Clitoral Volume & Blood Flow Changes ( 14:30 – 22:00 )\nBoth contraceptive methods led to significant reductions in clitoral volume nearly 20% in pill users and around 12–13% in ring users. Pill users also experienced reduced clitoral blood flow, while ring users did not.\nHormonal Mechanisms Behind the Changes ( 22:00 – 27:30 )\nLisa explains how suppressed testosterone and increased SHBG contribute to tissue atrophy, reduced lubrication, and decreased sexual response. She connects these findings to broader research on hormonal suppression.\nSexual Function Outcomes: Desire, Orgasm, and Pain ( 27:30 – 31:30 )\nBoth groups reported declines in libido and orgasm frequency, with more severe effects in pill users. Pain with intercourse and reduced lubrication were reported primarily in the pill group.\nWhy the Pill Appears Worse Than the Ring ( 31:30 – 35:30 )\nResearchers theorized that oral estrogen causes greater hormonal disruption than the vaginal ring due to higher SHBG spikes and reduced free testosterone. Lisa emphasizes that “less harmful” does not mean harmless.\nCriticism, Sample Size, and Missing Follow-Up Research ( 35:30 – 39:00 )\nLisa addresses the “small sample size” critique and questions why such striking findings were never followed up on. She discusses financial, ethical, and cultural barriers to deeper contraceptive research.\nAre These Changes Permanent? ( 39:00 – 41:30 )\nWhile the study did not examine recovery after stopping contraceptives, Lisa reviews existing post-pill research showing that hormone levels and sexual function often recover over time, though the transition can take months or years.\nInformed Consent and Women’s Lived Experience ( 41:30 – 43:00 )\nLisa concludes by emphasizing that sharing research is not “anti-birth control.” It is about empowering women with accurate information so they can choose what works best for their bodies.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources Mentioned\nClitoral Vascularization and Sexual Behavior in Young Patients Treated with Drospirenone–Ethinyl Estradiol or Contraceptive Vaginal Ring: A Prospective, Randomized, Pilot Study\nFertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship Program\nThe Practitioner’s Guide to Optimizing Egg Quality\nDownload a free chapter of The Fifth Vital Sign\nDownload a free chapter of Real Food for Fertility\nRelated Podcast Episodes\nFFP 479 | The Pill Problem | Ross Pelton, PhD.\nFFP 472 | Sexual Side Effects of Birth Control | Clitoral Shrinkage?!? | FAMM Research Series | Lisa | Fertility Friday\nFFP 463 | Does The Pill Lower AMH Levels? | The Pill & Your Fertility | Pill Reality Series | Lisa & Amanda\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.

    "main_text": "Podcast Host:\nLisa Hendrickson-Jack is a fertility awareness educator, author of The Fifth Vital Sign, and host of the Fertility Friday Podcast. With over two decades of experience in menstrual cycle education, Lisa specializes in translating reproductive health research into practical insights for women and practitioners.\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nEpisode Overview:\nIn Episode 603, Lisa explores a compelling area of menstrual cycle research and evolutionary biology: how women perceive their own attractiveness, confidence, and sexual desire across the menstrual cycle. The episode centers on a large-scale 2021 study examining daily self-reports from nearly 900 women to assess changes in self-rated attractiveness, mood, sexual desire, and grooming behaviors. By comparing naturally cycling women with women using hormonal contraceptives, the study offers valuable insight into the role of ovulation and cyclical hormones in shaping women’s lived experiences.\nKey Topics Covered:\nEvolutionary biology and menstrual cycle research\nOvulation and changes in perceived attractiveness\nDifferences between naturally cycling women and hormonal contraceptive users\nSelf-rated attractiveness, confidence, and sexual desire across the cycle\nGrooming behavior and appearance-related changes near ovulation\nMood and self-esteem fluctuations during the fertile window\nWhat hormonal contraceptives may suppress or flatten the cyclical experience\nWhy cycle literacy matters for understanding behavior and health\nListener Takeaways\nOvulation is associated with measurable changes in how naturally cycling women perceive their own attractiveness, confidence, and sexual desire.\nThese cyclical shifts are driven by hormonal changes, not conscious behavior or social conditioning.\nMood, desire, and self-perception tend to peak near ovulation, though individual experiences vary widely.\nUnderstanding cycle-related changes can help women normalize their experiences rather than pathologize them.\nFertility awareness offers valuable context for interpreting emotional, relational, and behavioral patterns across the cycle.\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nIntroduction to Evolutionary Biology & Cycle Behavior ( 00:00 – 02:30 )\nLisa introduces the episode topic and frames the discussion within evolutionary biology. She explains why researchers study behavioral and emotional changes across the menstrual cycle and references prior research, including studies on attractiveness and ovulation. This sets the stage for understanding how hormones may influence self-perception and behavior.\nOverview of the 2021 Large-Scale Diary Study ( 02:30 – 06:00 )\nLisa outlines the study design, including the sample size of 872 women and the comparison between naturally cycling women and hormonal contraceptive users. She explains how participants completed daily reports over 70 days and how researchers estimated cycle phases without direct ovulation testing. Strengths and limitations of the methodology are discussed.\nOvulation and Self-Perceived Attractiveness ( 06:00 – 10:00 )\nThis segment covers the study’s main finding: naturally cycling women reported feeling more attractive and sexually desirable in the days leading up to ovulation. Lisa explains why this result was consistent across multiple analyses and how it aligns with real-world cycle charting experiences.\nSexual Desire, Confidence, and Mood Changes ( 10:00 – 13:30 )\nLisa reviews findings related to sexual desire, self-esteem, and mood. She notes that while sexual desire increased most clearly around ovulation, mood and confidence also showed modest improvements. She emphasizes that these are trends, not rigid rules, and that individual experiences vary.\nGrooming Behavior and External Expression ( 13:30 – 16:30 )\nThe conversation shifts to grooming behaviors such as clothing choices and appearance-related effort. Lisa explains that while there was a slight increase in grooming around ovulation, it was less pronounced than internal shifts like confidence and desire, suggesting perception changes precede behavior changes.\nHormonal Contraceptives and Flat Cycle Patterns ( 16:30 – 19:00 )\nLisa explains that women using hormonal contraceptives did not show cyclical changes in attractiveness, desire, or mood. She connects this finding to ovulation suppression and reinforces the idea that ovulation drives these cyclical experiences.\nClinical Implications and Cycle Literacy ( 19:00 – 22:00 )\nLisa discusses what these findings mean for women’s health and fertility awareness education. She highlights how cycle charting helps normalize experiences, identify trends, and recognize when symptoms may point to underlying imbalances rather than “just hormones.”\nNuance, Individuality, and Closing Reflections ( 22:00 – 24:00 )\nThe episode concludes with reflections on nuance and personalization. Lisa stresses that hormones influence tendencies, not destiny, and that understanding cyclical patterns can be empowering rather than limiting. She encourages listeners to view the menstrual cycle as valuable data, not a liability.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources Mentioned\nWomen feel more attractive before ovulation: evidence from a large-scale online diary study\nApply to the Fertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship (FAMM)\nDownload a free chapter of The Fifth Vital Sign\nDownload a free chapter of Real Food for Fertility\nRelated Podcast Episodes\nFFP 593 | The Period Brain | Sarah Hill, PhD\nFFP 271 | Sexual Pleasure & Redefining “Sex” | Amy Baldwin & April Lampert\nFFP 233 | Progesterone and the Importance of Regular Ovulation | Dr. Jerilynn Prior\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.

The conversation explores the root causes of bloating, food sensitivities, and other gut-related issues. They discuss the limitations of elimination diets and why they may only provide temporary relief, while addressing deeper gut health concerns is key to long-term healing. Tune in for practical insights on managing gut health and addressing the root causes of digestive discomfort.\nKey Topics Covered:\nThe challenges of elimination diets and their temporary relief.\nRoot causes of digestive issues: low stomach acid, gut dysbiosis, and gallbladder/liver function.\nThe role of stress, trauma, and other factors in gut health.\nThe connection between hormonal contraceptives and gut health disruption.\nThe importance of addressing root causes before relying on dietary restrictions.\nListener Takeaways:\nElimination diets may temporarily ease symptoms, but don’t address the underlying issues that cause digestive discomfort.\nChronic bloating and digestive problems can stem from factors like low stomach acid, gut dysbiosis, and imbalances in gut bacteria.\nOver-reliance on restrictive diets like low FODMAP can cause long-term food sensitivities and worsen gut health.\nSupporting gut health involves more than just removing problematic foods—it’s about understanding the deeper factors affecting digestion and taking a holistic approach to healing.\nHormonal contraceptives can impact gut health, contributing to issues like bloating, yeast infections, and bacterial imbalances in the gut.\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nIntroduction to the Episode & Sponsor ( 00:00 – 04:30 )\nLisa introduces the episode and mentions the Fertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship Certification program. She emphasizes that this is an opportunity for women’s health professionals to master advanced menstrual charting and deepen their understanding of fertility awareness.\nIntroduction to Hanna Aylward & Her Journey ( 04:30 – 10:00 )\nHanna shares her personal story of struggling with digestive issues and how her experience led her to study gut health. She discusses how restrictive diets like elimination diets only provided partial relief and how understanding the root causes of gut issues led her to a better solution.\nUnderstanding Root Causes of Digestive Issues ( 10:00 – 15:30 )\nHanna explains how issues like low stomach acid, gut dysbiosis, and imbalances in gut bacteria contribute to chronic bloating and discomfort. She discusses how these imbalances can make foods like apples, garlic, and onions difficult to digest.\nThe Role of Stress, Trauma, and Lifestyle Factors ( 15:30 – 22:00 )\nLisa and Hanna discuss how chronic stress, childhood trauma, and lifestyle habits like undereating or over-exercising can contribute to gut dysfunction. Hanna explains how these factors lead to gut dysbiosis and digestive problems.\nThe Connection Between Hormonal Contraceptives and Gut Health ( 22:00 – 27:30 )\nHanna talks about the impact of hormonal contraceptives on gut health, including how they disrupt the gut microbiome. She highlights research showing that hormonal birth control, including IUDs, can lead to bacterial imbalances and digestive issues.\nUnderstanding Histamine Sensitivity and Food Sensitivities ( 27:30 – 33:30 )\nThe conversation shifts to histamine sensitivity and the rise of food sensitivities, especially in relation to estrogen levels. Hanna explains how hormonal fluctuations can exacerbate sensitivities and discusses how addressing these sensitivities involves more than just eliminating certain foods.\nThe Downside of Restrictive Diets (FODMAPs, Low Histamine, and More) ( 33:30 – 40:30 )\nHanna discusses the potential drawbacks of long-term restrictive diets like low FODMAP and low histamine diets. While they may provide short-term relief, they don’t address the root causes of digestive issues and can worsen sensitivities over time.\nImproving Digestion: Practical Tips ( 40:30 – 45:30 )\nHanna shares practical tips for improving digestion, including the importance of deep breathing before meals, chewing food thoroughly, and being present during meals. She also emphasizes the importance of gut microbiome diversity and consuming polyphenol-rich foods.\nWhen to Seek Professional Help and Testing ( 45:30 – 51:30 )\nLisa and Hanna talk about how to know when it’s time to seek help from a practitioner for deeper testing and support. They discuss the value of lab tests, gut health assessments, and working with a professional who understands the root causes of digestive issues.\nFinal Thoughts on Gut Health and the Need for a Holistic Approach ( 51:30 – 56:00 )\nHanna shares her final thoughts on gut health, urging listeners not to accept feeling “normal” when they are dealing with digestive discomfort. She encourages women to seek out support, look for the root causes, and avoid the trap of food restriction that leads to further issues.\nClosing & Call to Action ( 56:00 – 59:00 )\nLisa wraps up the episode by reminding listeners about the Fertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship Certification and encourages them to explore the resources Hanna offers, including her gut health quiz\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources and Mentions\nHannah Website and Hannah Website and Hannah’s Instagram\nThe Nutrient Dense Podcast\nGut Health Root Cause Quiz\nFAMM Mentorship Program\nThe Practitioner’s Guide to Optimizing Egg Quality\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.

    "main_text": "Podcast Host:\nLisa Hendrickson-Jack is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nEpisode Overview:\nIn Episode 600 of the Fertility Friday Podcast, Lisa Hendrickson-Jack explores a critical question often raised by both users and practitioners: Is fertility awareness too complicated to use effectively? Drawing from a real-world research study on fertility awareness users, Lisa examines the relationship between stated intention, user behavior, and pregnancy outcomes. This episode highlights why unintended pregnancies are rarely due to method failure and instead stem from user behavior, shifting intentions, and lack of structure. The discussion is especially relevant for women’s health professionals who teach fertility awareness-based methods and want to support clients with clarity and confidence.\nKey Topics Covered:\nWhether fertility awareness is inherently difficult to use\nThe difference between method failure and user failure\nHow intention and behavior influence pregnancy outcomes\nKey findings from a real-world fertility awareness study\nWhy pre-ovulatory management is the cornerstone of effectiveness\nThe role of structure, training, and practitioner guidance\nWhy do double-check sympto-thermal methods show higher efficacy\nListener Takeaways:\nFertility awareness is not too difficult when taught with the right structure\nMost unintended pregnancies occur due to user behavior, not method failure\nIntention can shift mid-cycle and must be openly discussed\nClear fertile window boundaries reduce confusion and risk\nPractitioner training is essential to support real-life complexity\nHigh efficacy depends on managing the pre-ovulatory phase accurately\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nIntroducing the Central Question ( 00:00 – 02:30 )\nLisa introduces the episode’s guiding question: Is fertility awareness too complicated? She explains why this topic matters for both personal users and women’s health professionals.\nOverview of the Research Study ( 02:30 – 05:30 )\nLisa introduces the study examining pregnancy intentions, behaviors, and outcomes among users of a mucus-only fertility awareness method. She explains why real-world data offers valuable insights.\nStudy Population & Participant Demographics ( 05:30 – 08:30 )\nDetails of the study population are reviewed, including age, relationship status, religious background, and experience level with fertility awareness methods.\nIntention vs. Behavior in Real Life ( 08:30 – 12:00 )\nLisa discusses how intentions are not static and can change mid-cycle. She explains why this mismatch between stated intention and behavior is common in clinical practice.\nFertile-Day Intercourse Despite Avoidance Intentions ( 12:00 – 15:30 )\nKey findings show that nearly one-third of cycles labeled as “avoiding” still included intercourse on known fertile days. Lisa explains how this impacts pregnancy outcomes.\nPregnancy Outcomes & Method Effectiveness ( 15:30 – 18:30 )\nLisa breaks down conception rates among those trying to conceive, those avoiding, and those ambivalent. She highlights the extremely low true method failure rate (.3%).\nThe Importance of Accurate Charting & Data Recording ( 18:30 – 21:00 )\nThe episode addresses the issue of incomplete intercourse tracking and why missing data undermines both research accuracy and client support.\nIs Fertility Awareness Too Complicated? ( 21:00 – 23:30 )\nLisa reframes the question, emphasizing that fertility awareness itself isn’t too complex; rather, lack of structure and clarity leads to confusion.\nThe Intention Scale & Human Nuance ( 23:30 – 26:00 )\nLisa introduces the intention scale and explains why most people fall somewhere in the middle, rather than fully avoiding or fully trying to conceive.\nWhy Double-Check Sympto-Thermal Methods Work Best ( 26:00 – 29:00 )\nLisa explains why methods using both cervical mucus and temperature offer higher efficacy by clearly defining the fertile window and reducing gray areas.\nPractitioner Responsibility & Training ( 29:00 – 31:30 )\nThis section highlights why charting your own cycle is not sufficient preparation for teaching others and why practitioner training is essential.\nFertility Awareness as a Planning Tool ( 31:30 – 33:00 )\nLisa explains how fertility awareness supports preconception health, cycle normalization, and informed family planning in ways hormonal methods cannot.\nFinal Reflections & Core Message ( 33:00 – 34:00 )\nThe episode concludes with the key takeaway: fertility awareness works when paired with the right system, structure, education, and practitioner support.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources mentioned\nHannah Website and Pregnancies, intentions, and fertility behaviors during use of the Creighton Model FertilityCare System after initial intention to avoid pregnancy: Results from the Creighton Model effectiveness, intentions, behaviors assessment study\nApply for the Fertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship\nDownload the free chapter of The Fifth Vital Sign\nDownload the free chapter of Real Food for Fertility\nRelated Podcast Episodes\nFFP 599 | [FAMM Practitioner Series] | Bringing Fertility Awareness To Midwifery | Kate Chantry\nFFP 597 | Are Women Ditching Birth Control For Fertility Awareness? | FAMM Research Series\nFFP 580 | Are Female Doctors More Knowledgeable About Fertility Awareness? | FAMM Research Series\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.

fertility awareness is a powerful addition to midwifery care.\nShe outlines how charting supports postpartum clients, family planning, and informed cycle education.\nThe episode is positioned as both practical and reflective for women’s health professionals.\nIntroducing Guest Kate Chantry ( 02:30 – 05:30 )\nKate shares her background as a licensed midwife, bodyworker, and mother practicing in rural Wisconsin.\nShe describes her roots in home birth and community-centered care.\nThis foundation shaped her interest in supporting women holistically across the reproductive lifespan.\nFirst Period & Early Cycle Experiences ( 05:30 – 10:30 )\nKate reflects on getting her first period and early beliefs about menstruation as limiting or burdensome.\nShe discusses irregular cycles, a brief loss of menstruation, and learning the role of nutrition and exercise.\nThese early experiences influenced how she later approached cycle health with clients.\nDiscovering Charting in Midwifery School ( 10:30 – 14:30 )\nKate describes her first exposure to cycle charting during midwifery training.\nShe explains why the mucus interpretation felt confusing and inconsistent at first.\nLater education helped her understand fertility signs with greater clarity and confidence.\nAvoiding Hormonal Birth Control & Early Fertility Experiences ( 14:30 – 18:00 )\nKate shares her experience of never using

why fertility awareness is often mistaken for the rhythm method.\nLack of education and structure leads many women to believe the method “doesn’t work.”\nProper instruction dramatically changes effectiveness and confidence.\nPractitioner Training & Client Success ( 33:00 – 34:30 )\nKate shares how structured training improved her ability to support complex cases.\nShe explains why charting your own cycle is not enough to teach others.\nProfessional education equips practitioners to meet diverse client needs.\nFinal Reflections & Encouragement ( 34:30 – 35:00 )\nKate reflects on how

Drawing from animal studies and human trials, she explains how female physiology—especially the menstrual cycle—has been excluded from study design. The episode highlights why this bias persists, how it affects women’s health outcomes, and what meaningful research reform could look like.\nKey Topics Covered\nHistorical exclusion of females from scientific research\nMale physiology as the default research model\nMenstrual cycle variability and flawed study designs\nDrug testing and hormone-related side effects\nSex bias in animal and human studies\nWhy women experience higher adverse drug reactions\nRecommendations for improving research methodology\nListener Takeaways\nMost biomedical research is still based on male biology\nFemale hormonal cycles are often ignored in study design\nDrug safety data frequently fail to account for women’s physiology\nSpot-testing hormones misses critical cycle-related changes\nResearch reform requires studying women as women\nUnderstanding bias improves how we interpret scientific claims\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nIntroduction to the Episode & Research Context ( 00:00 – 01:30 )\nLisa introduces the episode as a continuation of her conversation with Dr. Sarah Hill. She outlines the core issue of sex bias in science, explaining that much of modern biomedical research has been based on male physiology and male animals, with major implications for women’s health.\nWhy Women Have Been Excluded From Scientific Research ( 01:30 – 03:30 )\nLisa explains how female animals and women have been systematically excluded from research since the 1930s due to assumptions about hormonal variability. She emphasizes how this exclusion has produced incomplete, misleading, and often unsafe conclusions.\nMale Physiology as the Default Scientific Standard ( 03:30 – 05:30 )\nThis segment explores how male biology became the assumed “default” in research. Lisa explains how findings were generalized to women without proper testing, shaping medical education, drug development, and clinical care.\nThe Study: Sex Bias in Animal and Biomedical Research ( 05:30 – 07:45 )\nLisa introduces the review paper Unmasking the Adverse Impacts of Sex Bias on Science and Research in Animal Welfare. She summarizes key findings, including that roughly 80% of animals used in research are male, and that sex-based analysis is rarely performed even when females are included.\nWhy Including Females Isn’t Enough ( 07:45 – 09:30 )\nLisa explains that simply adding female subjects does not solve the problem if results are not analyzed by sex. She discusses how failing to report sex-specific outcomes limits clinical relevance and masks meaningful differences.\nOvary Removal and Flawed Research Practices ( 09:30 – 11:00 )\nThis section covers the practice of removing ovaries from female animals to reduce hormonal variability. Lisa explains why this undermines the entire purpose of studying sex differences and produces data that do not reflect real female physiology.\nStudying Women at “Low Hormone” Phases ( 11:00 – 13:00 )\nLisa discusses how women are often studied only during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. She explains why avoiding high-estrogen and high-progesterone phases prevents researchers from identifying important hormone–drug interactions.\nPMDD Research and the Limits of Spot Hormone Testing ( 13:00 – 15:30 )\nLisa revisits PMDD research that dismissed progesterone involvement based on a single mid-luteal measurement. She explains why one-time testing fails to capture late-luteal hormone changes that are clinically relevant.\nWhy Better Study Design Requires More Effort ( 15:30 – 18:00 )\nLisa outlines what an improved research design could look like, including cycle tracking, ovulation confirmation, and multiple testing points. She acknowledges increased complexity and cost but argues that accuracy and safety must come first.\nAnimal Welfare and the Cost of Sex Bias ( 18:00 – 20:00 )\nThe episode highlights how excluding female animals leads to unnecessary animal waste. Lisa explains how better inclusion could improve scientific validity while also reducing ethical and welfare concerns.\nWhy This Matters for Women’s Health Today ( 20:00 – 22:30 )\nLisa connects research bias to real-world outcomes, including unexpected side effects, misprescribing, and higher adverse drug reactions in women. She emphasizes that many medications were never adequately tested across the menstrual cycle.\nReframing Female Biology in Science ( 22:30 – 24:00 )\nLisa argues that female physiology should be treated as foundational rather than inconvenient. She explains that embracing hormonal cycles is essential for meaningful scientific progress.\nClosing Thoughts & Call to Critical Thinking ( 24:00 – 25:00 )\nLisa encourages listeners to read research critically, look beyond abstracts, and question study design and assumptions. She emphasizes that progress begins with demanding better, more honest science.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources Mentioned\nUnmasking the Adverse Impacts of Sex Bias on Science and Research Animal Welfare\nPractitioner’s Guide to Optimizing Egg Quality\nFertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship (FAMM)\nRelated Podcast Episodes\nFFP 581 | Uh Oh!

Lisa clarifies the role of AMH in understanding ovarian reserve, why it’s often misunderstood, and what it truly indicates. This episode is essential for women who are trying to conceive, struggling with fertility issues, or practitioners who want to better support their clients through AMH-related concerns.\nKey Topics Covered\nWhat AMH (Anti-Müllerian Hormone) is and how it relates to ovarian reserve\nCommon misconceptions about AMH, including its ability to predict fertility and menopause\nHow AMH levels fluctuate with age and what they really tell us about a woman’s fertility\nThe link between AMH levels and conditions like PCOS and endometriosis\nThe role of AMH in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), such as IVF, and how it helps predict ovarian response\nWhy AMH is not a reliable predictor of natural conception or pregnancy success\nThe importance of age and overall health in fertility, despite AMH levels\nResearch findings on AMH’s limitations and its use in clinical practice\nListener Takeaways\nAMH is not a crystal ball; it estimates ovarian reserve but does not predict fertility or the likelihood of pregnancy\nA low AMH level does not guarantee infertility, and women with low AMH can still conceive naturally\nEgg quality matters more than quantity, and lifestyle changes can improve fertility regardless of AMH levels\nAMH is most useful for planning IVF treatments and adjusting ovarian stimulation protocols, not for predicting natural conception outcomes\nFertility declines with age, but AMH is only one part of the picture and does not reflect egg health\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nIntroduction to AMH and Ovarian Reserve ( 00:00 – 02:00 )\nLisa introduces the topic of AMH and explains why it is important for women and fertility practitioners to understand the truth about this hormone. She discusses how misconceptions around AMH can lead to unnecessary fear and stress for women trying to conceive.\nWhat is AMH and What Does it Measure? ( 02:00 – 06:30 )\nLisa breaks down the role of AMH in the body, explaining how it reflects ovarian reserve and the number of eggs a woman has left. She outlines the connection between AMH and the antral follicle count, explaining how this measure has evolved over time.\nCommon Misconceptions About AMH ( 06:30 – 09:30 )\nLisa debunks myths about AMH, including its ability to predict fertility and menopause. She explains why AMH levels are not static and how they can be influenced by factors like diet, stress, and certain health conditions such as PCOS and endometriosis.\nAMH and Its Role in IVF Treatments ( 09:30 – 13:30 )\nThe conversation shifts to how AMH is used in ART, particularly IVF, to help clinicians determine the appropriate dosage for ovarian stimulation. Lisa explains how AMH levels correlate with egg retrieval and how it helps predict ovarian response during IV\nThe Role of Age in Fertility and AMH ( 13:30 – 17:00 )\nLisa discusses the impact of age on fertility, stressing that while AMH can indicate ovarian reserve, it cannot predict a woman’s ability to conceive naturally. She explains how the decline in fertility with age is not solely reflected by AMH but is influenced by many other factor\nHow to Focus on Egg Quality Over Quantity ( 17:00 – 19:30 )\nLisa emphasizes that the health of the eggs is more important than the quantity, and that women should focus on improving egg quality through diet, supplementation, and lifestyle changes rather than relying solely on AMH number\nAMH, Natural Conception, and Research Findings ( 19:30 – 22:00 )\nThe discussion continues on the limitations of AMH in predicting natural conception, with Lisa referencing studies showing that women with low AMH levels can still conceive naturally. She stresses the importance of looking at the whole picture when assessing fertility.\nConclusion and Final Thoughts ( 22:00 – 24:00 )\nLisa wraps up the episode by reinforcing the idea that AMH is just one part of the fertility puzzle. She encourages women to focus on supporting their fertility through healthy lifestyle choices, and for practitioners to keep up-to-date with current research on fertility and ovarian reserve.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources Mentioned\nEvaluation of Female Fertility—AMH and Ovarian Reserve Testing\nApply for the Fertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship\nDownload the Practitioner’s Guide to Optimizing Egg Quality\nReal Food for Fertility – Free Chapter Available\nDownload the free chapter of The Fifth Vital Sign\nRelated Podcast Episodes\nFFP 517 | Optimizing Egg Quality | Real Food for Fertility\nFFP 503 | Can Vitamin D Improve AMH Levels? | FAMM Research Series | Lisa | Fertility Friday\nFFP 464 | Does Low AMH or High FSH Mean You Can’t Conceive Naturally? | FAMM Research Series | Lisa | Fertility Friday\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.

As the host of the Fertility Friday Podcast and author of The Fifth Vital Sign, Lisa helps women and practitioners understand the menstrual cycle as a powerful diagnostic tool for fertility, hormone health, and overall well-being.\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nEpisode Overview:\nIn this episode of the Fertility Friday Podcast, Lisa explores the crucial role of vitamin A in sperm production and male fertility. Focusing on research, particularly a narrative review on retinoic acid and its influence on spermatogenesis, she highlights the vital connection between nutrition and male reproductive health. The episode emphasizes why vitamin A deficiency can lead to cessation of sperm production and discusses the significant impact of consuming vitamin A-rich foods like liver on sperm health.\nKey Topics Covered:\nThe importance of vitamin A in sperm and testosterone production\nRetinoic acid as a key factor in spermatogenesis\nAnimal and human studies on the effects of vitamin A deficiency\nThe role of nutrition in supporting sperm health\nThe implications of retinoic acid in male fertility conditions\nResearch on organ meat consumption and sperm quality\nThe potential use of vitamin A as a contraceptive method\nThe link between vitamin A and oxidative stress in male fertility\nListener Takeaways:\nVitamin A is essential for optimal sperm production.\nLiver and other organ meats are rich sources of vitamin A.\nDeficiency in vitamin A can halt sperm production entirely.\nRetinoic acid pulses regulate sperm production on a daily basis.\nAnimal studies show the reversibility of sperm production when vitamin A is reintroduced.\nRegular consumption of vitamin A-rich foods can improve sperm quality.\nLow sperm counts and poor quality can potentially be improved with vitamin A supplementation.\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nEpisode Introduction ( 00:00 – 05:00 )\nLisa introduces the episode’s topic, explaining the importance of vitamin A in sperm production and its overlooked role in male fertility. She sets the stage for discussing the research on retinoic acid, the active form of vitamin A, and its pivotal role in spermatogenesis. This episode centers around how vitamin A directly impacts both sperm and testosterone production.\nVitamin A’s Impact on Male Reproductive Health ( 05:00 – 08:00 )\nThe episode dives into the findings from a narrative review that highlights how retinoic acid plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis. Lisa explains how vitamin A deficiency can essentially stop sperm production entirely in animal models. She emphasizes that this nutrient is essential for maintaining healthy sperm development and testosterone levels, making it fundamental to male fertility.\nThe Role of Vitamin A in Spermatogenesis ( 08:00 – 10:00 )\nLisa breaks down the role of retinoic acid in the process of sperm production. Retinoic acid, derived from vitamin A, acts as an “on switch” for sperm development by regulating gene expression within the testes. This section elaborates on how retinoic acid pulses guide sperm production on a daily schedule, making it a constant process for men, unlike the cyclical fertility of women.\nThe Importance of Consuming Vitamin A-Rich Foods ( 10:00 – 13:00 )\nLisa discusses the dietary sources of vitamin A, specifically highlighting animal foods such as liver, cod liver oil, and fatty animal products. She clarifies that while beta-carotene found in plant foods like carrots is often associated with vitamin A, it is the preformed vitamin A (retinol) found in animal-based foods that is crucial for spermatogenesis. The liver serves as the storage organ for vitamin A, and it is essential that men consume adequate amounts of these foods to maintain proper sperm health.\nAnimal Studies and Vitamin A Deficiency ( 13:00 – 17:00 )\nThe episode reviews animal studies showing the profound effects of vitamin A deficiency on sperm production. Lisa emphasizes how, in these studies, a lack of vitamin A led to the cessation of sperm production and a reduction in testicle size. When vitamin A was reintroduced into the diet, sperm production was restored. This highlights the essential, reversible nature of vitamin A’s impact on male fertility, stressing its importance for sperm health.\nResearch on Male Fertility Conditions ( 17:00 – 20:00 )\nLisa explores the link between vitamin A and various male fertility conditions. Specifically, she discusses cryptorchidism, a condition where one or both testicles fail to descend properly at birth, and how a deficiency in retinoic acid correlates with lower sperm production in these cases. The episode also highlights studies on varicocele, a condition affecting sperm quality, and the potential role of vitamin A in alleviating oxidative stress in sperm cells to improve fertility outcomes.\nVitamin A and Sperm Quality ( 20:00 – 22:00 )\nThis section covers research that shows the positive effects of vitamin A on sperm quality. Studies have demonstrated that men who consume vitamin A-rich foods like liver have higher sperm count, concentration, and motility compared to those who do not consume these foods. Lisa discusses how these findings provide valuable insights for improving sperm parameters in men who may be facing fertility challenges.\nRetinoic Acid and Its Connection to Contraception ( 22:00 – 25:00 )\nLisa delves into the exploration of retinoic acid as a potential male contraceptive. Given its direct effect on sperm production, researchers have considered depriving men of vitamin A to suppress sperm production as a contraceptive method. Lisa explains how this idea fits into the broader context of fertility control and highlights the need for further research in this area.\nFinal Thoughts & Recommendations ( 25:00 – 27:00 )\nLisa concludes the episode by summarizing the critical importance of vitamin A for sperm production and male fertility. She emphasizes the need for men to consider incorporating vitamin A-rich foods, like liver, into their diets to support reproductive health. She also suggests that couples trying to conceive should be aware of the role of nutrition, especially vitamin A, in male fertility and considers the benefits of nutrient-based approaches over supplementation.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources Mentioned\nThe Role of Retinoic Acid in Spermatogenesis and Its Application in Male Reproduction\nThe Practitioner’s Guide to Optimizing Egg Quality\nFertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship\nReal Food for Fertility\nRelated Podcast Episodes\nFFP 504 | Vitamin D & Fibroids | FAMM Research Series | Lisa | Fertility Friday\nFFP 385 | Low-Fat Diets & Testosterone In Men | Boosting Sperm Quality | Joe Whittaker\nFFP 321 | Improving Sperm Quality | Everything You Need To Know About Male Factor Infertility | Marc Sklar\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.

They explore the fascinating science behind progesterone, its effects on women’s health, and how research on women’s hormones is often misunderstood. Dr. Hill explains how the lack of accurate research on women’s health, particularly the under-representation of women in scientific studies, has led to misconceptions about female physiology. The conversation highlights the psychological and physical changes women experience in the second half of their cycle and how societal pressures often contribute to the misunderstanding of women’s hormonal realities.\nKey Topics Covered:\nThe importance of progesterone in the second half of the menstrual cycle\nHow menstrual cycle research has historically excluded women\nThe science behind PMS and hormonal fluctuations in women\nWhy progesterone is often overlooked despite its crucial role in health\nThe consequences of minimal research on women’s hormonal health\nHow hormonal shifts during the cycle affect women’s mental, physical, and emotional states\nThe need for more comprehensive studies on women’s health, especially in drug trials and treatment efficacy\nListener Takeaways:\nProgesterone plays a crucial role in both physical and psychological aspects of women’s health, but is often overlooked in research.\nWomen’s hormonal fluctuations impact everything from mood and behavior to the efficacy of medications.\nResearch on women’s health has been largely based on male-centric models, leading to an incomplete understanding of female physiology.\nUnderstanding the menstrual cycle and tracking hormonal changes can empower women to make informed decisions about their health.\nThe hormonal shifts in women’s cycles require tailored healthcare approaches that account for these changes.\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nEpisode Introduction & Dr. Sarah Hill’s Background ( 00:00 – 05:00 )\nLisa introduces Dr. Sarah Hill, an award-winning researcher and author of This Is Your Brain on Birth Control and her new book The Period Brain. They discuss the overarching themes of the episode: the under-representation of women in scientific research and how hormonal fluctuations, particularly progesterone, affect women’s health. Dr. Hill highlights how the research on female hormones is lacking, which has led to widespread misconceptions about women’s health.\nThe Dark Half of the Menstrual Cycle ( 05:00 – 10:00 )\nDr. Hill explains how the second half of the menstrual cycle (the luteal phase) is often ignored in discussions about women’s health. She dives into the role of progesterone and how its influence is not well understood in both the scientific community and the general public. Lisa and Dr. Hill discuss how the lack of awareness about progesterone contributes to the confusion and distress that women experience during this phase of the cycle.\nWhy Progesterone Is Overlooked ( 10:00 – 15:00 )\nDr. Hill shares her research on the importance of progesterone in the luteal phase. She highlights how research often focuses on estrogen, leaving progesterone in the background. The conversation covers how the medical community and mainstream discussions about women’s hormones typically leave out progesterone, which plays a significant role in everything from mood regulation to bone health.\nPMS and Its Connection to Progesterone ( 15:00 – 20:00 )\nThe conversation shifts to the emotional and physical symptoms women experience during PMS. Dr. Hill explains that PMS is not a biological defect but a predictable response to hormonal fluctuations, particularly progesterone. She argues that understanding what is happening in the body during the luteal phase can help women better manage the symptoms associated with PMS.\nThe Problem with One-Size-Fits-All Research ( 20:00 – 25:00 )\nDr. Hill discusses how research on women’s health has historically been designed around male models. She explains that until recently, most research studies only included men or studied women during a narrow window of their cycle, typically the follicular phase when estrogen is dominant. This approach has resulted in a lack of understanding about how women’s bodies respond to medications and interventions across the entire cycle.\nThe Importance of Sex Differentiation in Research ( 25:00 – 30:00 )\nDr. Hill addresses the need for more research focused on sex differentiation. She explains that male and female bodies are different and that these differences should be considered when designing scientific studies. Dr. Hill advocates for including women in studies at different points of their cycle and ensuring that the impacts of hormonal fluctuations are accounted for in medical research.\nHow Hormonal Fluctuations Affect Women’s Health ( 30:00 – 35:00 )\nDr. Hill delves deeper into how hormonal changes impact women’s mental and physical health. She discusses how progesterone influences the brain and body, including changes in mood, motivation, and sleep during the luteal phase. Dr. Hill emphasizes that women’s health is often misunderstood because our bodies operate on cyclical hormonal rhythms, unlike the more consistent hormone levels in men.\nAddressing the Cycle’s Impact on Chronic Health Conditions ( 35:00 – 40:00 )\nThe conversation moves to the intersection of women’s hormonal cycles and chronic health conditions like asthma, ADHD, and autoimmune diseases. Dr. Hill explains how symptoms of these conditions can change during different phases of the menstrual cycle. For example, many women experience worsening asthma symptoms during the luteal phase. Understanding this can help women receive more tailored care during these times.\nThe Role of Progesterone in Autoimmune Diseases ( 40:00 – 45:00 )\nDr. Hill explores the relationship between progesterone and autoimmune diseases. She discusses the concept of the “pregnancy prevention hypothesis,” which suggests that the high rates of autoimmune diseases in women today could be related to the fact that women are no longer pregnant as frequently as in the past. This loss of progesterone’s anti-inflammatory effects could be contributing to increased autoimmunity.\nThe Need for Comprehensive Research on Women’s Health ( 45:00 – 50:00 )\nDr. Hill calls for a complete overhaul of how women’s health is studied. She stresses the importance of including women in research and accounting for the different hormonal phases of their cycles. She also advocates for more accurate representation of female physiology in medical treatments, particularly in drug trials, where women’s hormonal fluctuations are often ignored.\nBuilding Resilience to Hormonal Changes ( 50:00 – 55:00 )\nDr. Hill shares practical advice for women to build resilience to hormonal changes. She talks about the importance of healthy lifestyle choices, including eating well, managing stress, and getting enough sleep. These factors help women adapt to hormonal shifts, making the changes less disruptive and more manageable.\nFinal Thoughts & Recommendations ( 55:00 – 58:00 )\nLisa and Dr. Hill wrap up the conversation by emphasizing the importance of understanding your own cycle and tracking your symptoms. Dr. Hill encourages women to educate themselves about their hormonal changes and seek out resources like The Period Brain to better understand what their bodies are going through. She ends with a call to action for women to trust their bodies and embrace their hormonal cycles.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect with Sarah Hill\nDr. Sarah Hill’s Official Website\nLinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter\nThe Period Brain\nThis is Your Brain on Birth Control\nResources Mentioned\nFertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship (FAMM)\nFertility Awareness Mastery Charting Workbook\nRelated Podcast Episodes\nFFP 368 | Why Your Doctor Isn’t Helping You With Your Period Problems | Aviva Romm, MD\nFFP 311 | Period Power | Maisie Hill\nFFP 297 | This is Your Brain on Birth Control | Dr. Sarah Hill, PhD.\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.

The paper discusses the growing trend of patients seeking out health information on TikTok due to dissatisfaction with the care they receive in medical settings. Lisa explains how this shift is affecting how women trust and interact with medical professionals.\nDistrust of Hormonal Contraception ( 28:00 – 32:00 )\nLisa explores the growing distrust of hormonal contraception, particularly in light of personal experiences shared on TikTok. She reflects on the study’s findings that many women who feel unheard by their healthcare providers are turning to alternative sources of information, like social media, to find answers.\nThe Need for Open Dialogue in Healthcare ( 32:00 – 36:00 )\nLisa highlights the importance of open dialogue between patients and healthcare providers. She discusses how the medical community must address the concerns raised by patients, particularly when it comes to the side effects of hormonal contraception. Lisa argues that medical professionals need to create a more inclusive and collaborative environment for contraceptive counseling.\nAcknowledging Patient Concerns in Social Media ( 36:00 – 40:00 )\nThe discussion turns to the paper’s conclusion that healthcare providers must acknowledge the role social media plays in shaping women’s views on contraceptive methods. Lisa shares a quote from the study, which recognizes that women are turning to social media because they feel dismissed or coerced by medical professionals.\nThe Growing Demand for Non-Hormonal Birth Control ( 40:00 – 44:00 )\nLisa reflects on the increasing demand for non-hormonal birth control methods. She highlights the importance of providing evidence-based information about fertility awareness and other alternatives to hormonal contraception.

She stresses that while misinformation on TikTok is a concern, there is a growing demand for accurate, evidence-based information. Lisa encourages women’s health professionals to engage with social media, provide balanced content, and offer a clear, informed perspective on reproductive health.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources Mentioned\n“Do You Know What Birth Control Actually Does to Your Body?”: Assessing Contraceptive Information on TikTok\nPractitioner’s Guide to Optimizing Egg Quality (Free Resource)\nFertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship\nReal Food for Fertility on Audible\nDownload the free chapter of The Fifth Vital Sign\nRelated Podcast Episodes\nFFP 550 | How Do Women Really Feel About Hormonal Birth Control? | FAMM Research Series\nFFP 515 | Birth Control “Misinformation” Online? | Lisa | Fertility Friday\n493 | Birth Control | Allison Yarrow\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.

As the host of the Fertility Friday Podcast and author of The Fifth Vital Sign, Lisa helps women and practitioners understand the menstrual cycle as a powerful diagnostic tool for fertility, hormone health, and overall well-being.\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nEpisode Overview:\nIn Episode 591 of the Fertility Friday Podcast, Lisa Hendrickson-Jack addresses the often-overlooked issue of pain during IUD insertion. She explores a new 2025 consensus statement from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), which acknowledges the real pain that many women experience during this procedure. The episode discusses the inadequacy of current pain management practices and highlights the importance of healthcare professionals understanding and addressing pain management for women undergoing gynecological procedures. Lisa also provides a fertility awareness perspective on the timing of IUD insertion and practical considerations for women undergoing this procedure.\nKey Topics Covered:\nThe prevalence of pain during IUD insertion and the importance of pain management\nACOG’s new consensus statement on pain management for cervical procedures\nUnderstanding the cervical anatomy and its impact on IUD insertion pain\nWhy common pain management strategies, like NSAIDs, may be ineffective for IUD insertion\nThe role of local anesthetics (lidocaine) in effective pain relief\nHow medical professionals should approach pain management for individual patients\nListener Takeaways:\nPain during IUD insertion is real, common, and often underestimated by healthcare professionals.\nACOG’s new guidelines recommend local anesthetics like lidocaine for effective pain relief during IUD insertion.\nThe lack of pain management during this procedure reflects broader issues of dismissing women’s pain in medical settings.\nWomen should advocate for their own pain management options during procedures, including IUD insertion.\nThe importance of considering cervical position and timing of insertion from a fertility awareness perspective.\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nIntroduction to IUD Insertion Pain ( 00:00 – 04:00 )\nLisa introduces the topic of IUD insertion pain and the ongoing issues with pain management during this procedure. She highlights the recent surge in women sharing their experiences of intense pain during IUD insertion.\nACOG’s Consensus Statement on Pain Management( 04:00 – 08:00 )\nLisa presents the key findings from the new ACOG consensus statement released in July 2025, which acknowledges the real and varied pain experiences that women have during procedures like IUD insertion. She discusses the statement’s recommendation for more comprehensive pain management strategies.\nMedical Professionals’ Misunderstanding of Pain ( 08:00 – 12:00 )\nLisa addresses the issue of many healthcare providers underestimating the pain women experience during IUD insertion. She emphasizes how biases, such as systemic racism and dismissive attitudes toward women’s pain, contribute to a lack of appropriate pain relief options.\nThe Definition of Pain in Medical Contexts ( 12:00 – 16:00 )\nThe episode dives into how pain is defined in the context of medical procedures, highlighting that pain is a highly subjective experience, and acknowledging that women’s pain during IUD insertion is often ignored or minimized.\nWhy IUD Insertion Pain is Often Ignored ( 16:00 – 20:00 )\nLisa explains the problem with healthcare providers not offering pain relief for IUD insertion, despite evidence showing that many women experience severe pain. She critiques the common approach of prescribing NSAIDs and highlights the inadequacy of this method.\nEffective Pain Management: Lidocaine ( 20:00 – 24:00 )\nLisa shares the findings from the consensus statement, which recommends the use of lidocaine as a local anesthetic to reduce pain during IUD insertion. She explains how this method is more effective than other options, like cervical ripening agents.\nThe Fertility Awareness Perspective on Cervical Anatomy ( 24:00 – 28:00 )\nFrom a fertility awareness standpoint, Lisa talks about how the cervix behaves during different phases of the menstrual cycle. She suggests that the best time to get an IUD inserted might be during the fertile window, when the cervix is naturally softer and more open, potentially making the procedure less painful.\nAddressing Bias in Pain Management ( 28:00 – 32:00 )\nLisa highlights how certain populations, such as women with a history of pelvic pain, abuse, or chronic conditions, may experience more pain during IUD insertion. She emphasizes the importance of healthcare providers being sensitive to these factors and offering pain management options for everyone.\nThe Role of Self-Advocacy in Pain Management ( 32:00 – 36:00 )\nThe conversation shifts to the importance of women advocating for themselves when it comes to pain management. Lisa provides practical tips for women to request pain relief options and ensures that they are taken seriously by medical professionals.\nRecommendations for Healthcare Providers ( 36:00 – 38:00 )\nLisa concludes the episode by reviewing the recommendations for healthcare providers from the consensus statement, urging them to listen to their patients, offer appropriate pain management options, and stop assuming that all women experience pain in the same way.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources Mentioned\nPain Management for In-Office Uterine and Cervical Procedures: ACOG Clinical Consensus No. 9\nThe Practitioner’s Guide to Optimizing Egg Quality\nFertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship (FAMM) – Apply Now\nListen to *Real Food for Fertility* free on Audible\nRelated Podcast Episodes\nFFP 450 | Fibroids & The IUD | Pill Reality Series | Lisa & Augustina\n[On-Air Client Session] FFP 434 | IUD Insertion Pain & Using Fertility Awareness For Birth Control | Sydney & Lisa\nFFP 161 | Are IUDs Safer Than The Pill? | Hormonal IUDs vs Copper IUDs | Dr. Steve Gangemi\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.

The study focuses on comparing women with PMDD to those without, and how they experience hormonal fluctuations, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and memory loss. Lisa critiques the study’s methodology, particularly how the researchers dismissed hormonal fluctuations and focused on a psychiatric approach. She highlights the importance of a comprehensive hormonal understanding in treating PMDD and PMS symptoms, emphasizing the need for menstrual cycle-based research.\nKey Topics Covered:\nUnderstanding the difference between PMDD and PMS\nCognitive performance and mood changes in PMDD\nThe study’s methodology: testing hormones and comparing control groups\nThe hormonal role in PMDD and the limitations of single hormone testing\nThe impact of food cravings and appetite changes in PMDD\nCritique of research methodology and its implications on treatment approaches\nListener Takeaways:\nPMDD is an exacerbated version of PMS, severely impacting daily life.\nResearch often overlooks the cyclical nature of hormones in PMDD.\nHormonal testing needs to be done across the entire luteal phase, not just spot tests.\nLifestyle interventions and tracking menstrual cycles can offer insights into PMDD.\nThere’s a need for more thorough research into the hormonal aspect of PMDD.\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nIntroduction to PMDD Study ( 00:00 – 03:30 )\nLisa introduces the topic of PMDD and sets the stage for the episode. She explains how PMDD is a severe form of PMS, defining it as debilitating rather than just inconvenient, and previews the discussion around a research study comparing mood, cognitive performance, and appetite in women with and without PMDD.\nThe Definition of PMDD and PMS ( 03:30 – 07:00 )\nLisa clarifies the difference between PMDD and PMS, focusing on how PMDD is defined by significant mood changes, irritability, fatigue, and cognitive impairment that interfere with daily functioning. She also discusses the typical timing of PMDD symptoms, appearing in the luteal phase, specifically the week before menstruation, and disappearing afterward.\nStudy Overview: Hormonal and Cognitive Changes in PMDD ( 07:00 – 10:30 )\nLisa reviews the research study titled “Changes in Mood, Cognitive Performance, and Appetite in Women with PMDD”. The study explored the psychological and cognitive changes in women with PMDD versus control women. Researchers looked at hormone levels, mood changes, cognitive performance, and food cravings during the luteal and follicular phases.\nResearchers’ Methodology and Its Limitations ( 10:30 – 14:00 )\nLisa critiques the study’s methodology, particularly the way hormones were tested. The researchers conducted spot hormone tests once during each phase of the cycle, without tracking how hormones fluctuated throughout the cycle. Lisa emphasizes that this is a major flaw in the study, especially when trying to understand a condition like PMDD, which is cyclical.\nCognitive Function and Mood Fluctuations in PMDD ( 14:00 – 18:00 )\nThe study found that women with PMDD showed significantly worse mood, cognitive performance, and appetite fluctuations compared to both their follicular phase and to control participants without PMDD. Memory tasks and word recall were notably worse for those with PMDD. Lisa highlights these findings, noting that the cognitive and emotional struggles are severe during the luteal phase.\nAppetite Changes and Food Cravings in PMDD ( 18:00 – 22:00 )\nLisa discusses the findings related to appetite. Women with PMDD were shown to consume about 100 more calories, primarily from fat and protein, during lunch. These findings align with the food cravings that often accompany PMDD. Lisa emphasizes the need for understanding the physical basis behind these cravings and how they may relate to hormonal fluctuations.\nThe Role of Hormones in PMDD ( 22:00 – 25:00 )\nLisa goes into more depth about the hormone testing conducted in the study. Despite the symptoms consistently being linked to the luteal phase, the study found no significant difference in estradiol or progesterone levels between the two groups. Lisa critiques the study’s conclusion that there is no hormonal component to PMDD, questioning how this could be deduced from such limited testing.\nCritique: One-Time Hormone Testing Is Insufficient ( 25:00 – 28:00 )\nLisa continues to discuss how the study’s single spot hormone test failed to capture the dynamic hormonal changes throughout the luteal phase. She calls for a more thorough hormonal analysis that would involve testing progesterone regularly throughout the luteal phase, not just once. This would give a clearer picture of the hormonal patterns that could be involved in PMDD.\nThe Psychiatric Approach to Treating PMDD ( 28:00 – 33:00 )\nThe study suggested that psychiatric medication (like SSRIs) could be the treatment for PMDD due to the absence of clear hormonal changes. Lisa critiques this approach, pointing out how psychiatric medications are often prescribed without considering hormonal contributions to mood and cognitive changes. She calls for a more integrative approach that considers both hormonal and psychiatric factors in treating PMDD.\nThe Need for Menstrual Cycle-Based Research ( 33:00 – 37:00 )\nLisa emphasizes the importance of conducting research that accounts for menstrual cycle fluctuations. She advocates for more research on how progesterone and estrogen change throughout the cycle and affect symptoms, especially in PMDD. By using a more nuanced approach, including tools like temperature tracking and mucus observation, researchers could gain a better understanding of the hormonal dynamics at play.\nThe Implications for Women’s Health and Treatment ( 37:00 – 40:00 )\nLisa discusses the broader implications of this flawed research for women’s health. She stresses the need for a new perspective, one that takes the menstrual cycle seriously and investigates the hormonal changes that occur throughout the cycle. Without this, women are at risk of being misdiagnosed or treated with medications that don’t address the root cause of their symptoms.\nWhy Menstrual Cycle Awareness Matters ( 40:00 – 45:00 )\nLisa ties the discussion back to the importance of menstrual cycle tracking. She explains how fertility awareness and understanding one’s cycle can help identify hormonal imbalances and pinpoint when issues like PMDD or PMS occur. Women can learn more about their bodies and how to work with their natural cycles for better health and well-being.\nThe Potential for Bioidentical Hormones and Lifestyle Changes ( 45:00 – 50:00 )\nLisa presents the potential of using bioidentical progesterone to help women who have hormonal imbalances contributing to PMDD. She contrasts this natural approach with psychiatric medications and highlights how lifestyle changes (including diet, exercise, and sleep) can improve symptoms and balance hormones.\nClosing Thoughts and Future Research ( 50:00 – 57:00 )\nLisa wraps up by highlighting the limitations of current research on PMDD and its impact on treatment. She urges a more holistic approach to studying and treating PMDD, emphasizing the need for better scientific methods that consider the full complexity of women’s hormonal health. She encourages listeners to continue to question conventional research and advocate for more comprehensive studies.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources Mentioned\nChanges in mood, cognitive performance and appetite in the late luteal and follicular phases of the menstrual cycle in women with and without PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder)\nThe Practitioner’s Guide to Optimizing Egg Quality\nReal Food for Fertility (Free Chapter)\nThe Fifth Vital Sign (Free Chapter)\nFAMM: Fertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship\nRelated Podcast Episodes\nFFP 574 | PMDD & The Menstrual Cycle | FAMM Research Series\n[FAMM Practitioner Series] FFP 443 | Overcoming PMDD | Uncovering The Link Between PMDD & OCD | Katy Ewen\n[On-Air Client Session] FFP 401 | Managing Severe PMDD | Alden & Lisa\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.

Together, they explore why the menstrual cycle should be considered a vital sign in psychiatry and how ignoring cyclical hormonal patterns has led to gaps in diagnosis, treatment, and patient care.\nDr. Marwick shares insights from her research paper, “The Menstrual Cycle as an Overlooked Vital Sign in Psychiatry,” highlighting how a wide range of psychiatric conditions—including depression, anxiety, psychosis, eating disorders, and bipolar disorder—can worsen predictably at specific phases of the menstrual cycle. The conversation challenges long-standing assumptions in psychiatric training, discusses the limitations of current treatment models, and emphasizes how simply asking about the menstrual cycle could dramatically improve outcomes for women.\nKey Topics Covered:\nWhy the menstrual cycle qualifies as a psychiatric vital sign\nThe difference between PMDD and premenstrual exacerbation\nPsychiatric conditions are shown to worsen premenstrually\nGaps in medical and psychiatric training around menstruation\nHormonal stabilization vs. psychiatric medication approaches\nHow cycle awareness can reduce hospitalizations and crises\nThe power of symptom tracking and anticipatory care planning\nListener Takeaways:\nMany psychiatric symptoms worsen predictably at specific cycle phases.\nPremenstrual symptom worsening extends far beyond PMDD.\nAsking about the menstrual cycle can unlock critical diagnostic insight.\nHormonal treatments may complement psychiatric care in some cases.\nUnderstanding cyclical patterns can be deeply empowering for patients.\nPsychiatry has historically overlooked female physiology in care models.\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nIntroducing the Menstrual Cycle as a Psychiatric Vital Sign ( 00:00 – 03:30 )\nLisa introduces the episode’s central theme: why the menstrual cycle should be considered a vital sign in psychiatric care. She previews the research paper that inspired the discussion and introduces Dr. Katie Marwick.\nDr. Katie Marwick’s Background & Research Focus ( 03:30 – 07:00 )\nDr. Marwick shares her work as a reproductive psychiatrist in Edinburgh and explains how working with women during reproductive transitions led her to question psychiatry’s lack of focus on menstrual cycles.\nGaps in Psychiatric Training ( 07:00 – 11:00 )\nDr. Marwick explains how menstruation, PMS, PMDD, and menopause are largely absent from psychiatric education. She notes that clinicians often don’t ask about cycles simply because they were never trained to consider them.\nPMDD vs. Premenstrual Exacerbation ( 11:00 – 16:00 )\nThe conversation clarifies the distinction between PMDD and premenstrual exacerbation, where existing psychiatric conditions worsen cyclically. Dr. Marwick explains why this distinction is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\nPsychiatric Conditions Linked to the Menstrual Cycle ( 16:00 – 21:00 )\nDr. Marwick outlines psychiatric conditions shown to worsen premenstrually, including depression, panic disorder, eating disorders, substance use disorders, borderline personality disorder, psychosis, and bipolar disorder.\nEvidence Supporting Cycle-Based Symptom Tracking ( 21:00 – 25:30 )\nDr. Marwick discusses research using prospectively recorded symptom data, showing strong evidence that psychiatric symptoms fluctuate in relation to menstrual cycle phases.\nWhy Patients Often Don’t Make the Connection ( 25:30 – 30:00 )\nLisa and Dr. Marwick explore why many women fail to recognize cyclical symptom patterns, citing cultural silence, lack of education, and coping mechanisms that prioritize survival over reflection.\nStigma, Assumptions, and Avoidance in Psychiatry ( 30:00 – 35:00 )\nDr. Marwick explains how discomfort, fear of invalidation, and historical misogyny contribute to psychiatry’s avoidance of menstrual health discussions.\nTreatment Models: SSRIs vs. Hormonal Approaches ( 35:00 – 39:30 )\nThe discussion compares traditional psychiatric medication approaches with hormonal stabilization strategies, including ovulation suppression and hormone-based interventions.\nPotential Benefits of Hormonal Stabilization ( 39:30 – 43:30 )\nDr. Marwick highlights research showing that addressing hormonal fluctuation—alongside standard psychiatric care—may significantly reduce hospital admissions, including up to a 50% reduction in psychotic disorders.\nEmpowerment Through Cycle Awareness ( 43:30 – 47:30 )\nLisa emphasizes how understanding cyclical symptom patterns helps patients anticipate difficult phases, build support plans, and reduce fear during symptom flare-ups.\nWhy Psychiatry Has Ignored the Menstrual Cycle ( 47:30 – 50:30 )\nDr. Marwick reflects on historical bias, male-centric medical models, and fears of oversimplifying women’s mental health by attributing symptoms to hormones.\nFinal Reflections & Core Message ( 50:30 – 52:00 )\nThe episode closes with a clear call to action: routinely ask whether mental health symptoms are linked to the menstrual cycle—and allow that question to guide more effective, compassionate care.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect with Dr. Marwick\nConnect with Dr. Katie Marwick on LinkedIn\nResources Mentioned\nThe Menstrual Cycle: An overlooked vital sign in psychiatry?\nPractitioner’s Guide to Optimizing Egg Quality\nRelated Podcast Episodes\nFFP 576 | Using The Menstrual Cycle As A Vital Sign In Adolescent Girls | FAMM Research Series\nFFP 574 | PMDD & The Menstrual Cycle | FAMM Research Series\nFFP 559 | Do ADHD Symptoms Change With The Menstrual Cycle? | FAMM Research Series\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.

The episode focuses on a study that explored sleep patterns in the days leading up to menstruation and during early menses, analyzing both subjective sleep reports and objective sleep-tracking data. Lisa offers a critical review of the study design, highlights gaps in hormone assessment, and challenges common assumptions about progesterone, PMS, and sleep disruption.\nKey Topics Covered:\nThe connection between sleep disturbances and the perimenstrual phase\nOverview and critique of the study “The Interaction of Sleep and Emotion Across the Menstrual Cycle.”\nDifferences between subjective sleep reports and objective sleep-tracking data\nMood changes associated with disrupted sleep around menstruation\nCommon research assumptions about progesterone, estrogen, and sleep\nLimitations of menstrual cycle research that do not accurately confirm ovulation or hormone patterns\nThe importance of viewing the menstrual cycle as a vital sign rather than an inherent problem\nListener Takeaways:\nSleep disturbances tend to increase in the days leading up to menstruation and early menses, but the experience may feel worse than objective data suggests.\nResearch often oversimplifies the role of hormones, particularly progesterone, without measuring them accurately.\nCorrelation between hormonal changes and symptoms does not automatically indicate causation.\nPMS and sleep issues are not universal and may reflect hormonal imbalance rather than normal female physiology.\nMore precise cycle tracking and hormone monitoring are essential for meaningful menstrual health research.\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nIntroduction and Study Overview ( 00:00 – 04:00 )\nLisa introduces the episode’s focus on sleep disturbances across the menstrual cycle. She explains why sleep quality is an important but often misunderstood topic in women’s health research and previews her critical analysis of the study’s conclusions.\nStudy Design and Cycle Phase Identification ( 04:00 – 08:00 )\nLisa breaks down how researchers identified menstrual cycle phases using self-reported bleeding and LH testing. She explains why accurate ovulation confirmation and hormone measurement are essential when interpreting cycle-based findings.\nSleep Tracking Methods and Key Findings ( 08:00 – 13:00 )\nThe episode explores how sleep was assessed using wrist-worn devices and sleep diaries. Lisa compares subjective reports of disrupted sleep with objective sleep data, highlighting why perceived wakefulness was significantly higher during certain cycle phases.\nMood Changes and the Emotional Impact of Poor Sleep ( 13:00 – 18:00 )\nLisa reviews findings related to mood changes, including increased irritability and frustration during the perimenstrual phase. She connects disrupted sleep to emotional well-being while cautioning against oversimplified hormonal explanations.\nCritiquing Progesterone and PMS Assumptions ( 18:00 – 23:00 )\nLisa challenges the assumption that progesterone inherently disrupts sleep due to increased body temperature. She explains normal luteal phase physiology and argues that hormone imbalance—not healthy progesterone function—is the more likely contributor to sleep issues.\nResearch Limitations and Future Directions ( 23:00 – 33:00 )\nThe episode concludes with a broader discussion on the limitations of menstrual cycle research. Lisa emphasizes the need for better hormone tracking, individualized analysis, and a shift away from framing women’s biology as inherently flawed or problematic.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources mentioned\nThe Interaction of Sleep and Emotion Across the Menstrual Cycle\nCentre for Menstrual Cycle and Ovulation Research (CeMCOR)\nReal Food for Fertility | Lisa Hendrickson-Jack and Lily Nichols\nThe Fifth Vital Sign: Master Your Cycles & Optimize Your Fertility (Book) | Lisa Hendrickson-Jack\nFertility Awareness Mastery Charting Workbook\nFertility Awareness Mastery Online Self-Study Program\nRelated podcasts & blog posts:\nFFP 556 | Overcoming Your Luteal Phase Carb Cravings | FAMM Research Series\nFFP 525 | Managing Extreme PMS Symptoms | Isobel Ripley\nFFP 475 | Caffeine And The Menstrual Cycle | FAMM Research Series | Lisa | Fertility Friday\nFFP 371 | Hypothalamic Amenorrhea & The Menstrual Cycle | Cynthia Donovan\nA Special Thank You to Our Show Sponsors:\nFertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship Program (FAMM)\nThis episode is sponsored by FAMM!

Lisa and Hihi discuss hospital versus home birth dynamics, the importance of aligned providers, and how preparation before labor can significantly impact postpartum healing and emotional well-being.\nKey Topics Covered:\nBirth trauma and how it develops\nAvoidable vs. unavoidable birth trauma\nHospital birth culture and systemic barriers\nMedical racism and the historical roots of obstetric care\nThe role of education and informed consent\nAdvocacy, autonomy, and patient rights in labor\nMidwifery care vs. obstetrical models\nFlexibility and realistic expectations for birth\nThe role of doulas and support teams\nPreparing for birth without fear or rigidity\nListener Takeaways:\nBirth trauma is often rooted in a lack of consent, communication, and respect\nEducation before birth significantly improves outcomes and confidence\nFlexibility reduces emotional distress when birth doesn’t go as planned\nHospital policies are not laws, and patients retain bodily autonomy\nAligned providers and advocacy support are critical\nPreparation supports both physical birth outcomes and emotional healing\nEvery woman deserves a birth experience rooted in dignity and respect\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nEpisode Introduction & Framing the Conversation ( 00:00 – 08:00 )\nLisa introduces the episode’s focus on birth experiences and trauma. She explains why education, preparation, and advocacy matter, especially for first-time mothers navigating complex medical systems.\nMeet Hihi Stewart & Her Background ( 08:00 – 16:00 )\nHihi shares her background in human development, early childhood education, and family systems. She explains how gaps in pre-birth education inspired her work supporting parents before labor begins.\nWhy Birth Feels So Hard for Many Women ( 16:00 – 26:00 )\nThe conversation explores cultural shifts, the loss of community support, childcare pressures, and how systemic structures contribute to fear, disempowerment, and overwhelm during birth.\nMedical Racism & Historical Roots of Obstetric Care ( 26:00 – 36:00 )\nHihi discusses the origins of gynecological care, medical racism, and how historical mistreatment of women—particularly Black women—continues to shape modern birth practices.\nDefining Birth Trauma ( 36:00 – 46:00 )\nBirth trauma is broken down into unavoidable trauma (such as loss or rare medical emergencies) and avoidable trauma caused by coercion, lack of consent, or dismissive care.\nConsent, Communication & Avoidable Trauma ( 46:00 – 56:00 )\nHihi shares examples of how trauma occurs when procedures are done without consent, pain is dismissed, or fear-based language is used. Clear communication is highlighted as a trauma-reducing tool.\nHospital vs. Midwifery Models & Autonomy ( 56:00 – 1:07:00 )\nLisa and Hihi compare obstetrical and midwifery models of care, discussing how trust is placed either in systems or in birthing individuals. The role of flexibility, preparation, and provider alignment is emphasized.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect with HeHe Stewart:\nYou can connect with HeHe on her website, Instagram, and Podcast.\nResources Mentioned\nReal Food for Fertility | Lisa Hendrickson-Jack and Lily Nichols\nThe Fifth Vital Sign: Master Your Cycles & Optimize Your Fertility (Book) | Lisa Hendrickson-Jack\nFertility Awareness Mastery Charting Workbook\nFertility Awareness Mastery Online Self-Study Program\nRelated Podcast Episodes\nFFP 572 | Is Red Light Therapy Beneficial For Menstrual Cycle Health? | Tracy Donegan\nFFP 568 | Barriers To Fertility Awareness Research | New Research on Miscarriage | Dr. Marguerite Duane, MD\nFFP 491 | Real Talk About Using FAM For Birth Control | Lisa | Fertility Friday\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.

As the host of the Fertility Friday Podcast and author of The Fifth Vital Sign, Lisa helps women understand their cycles, hormones, and reproductive health so they can make informed decisions.\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nEpisode Overview:\nIn Episode 582 of the Fertility Friday Podcast, Lisa Hendrickson-Jack interviews Dr. Naomi Whitaker, a board-certified OBGYN fertility surgeon specializing in restorative reproductive medicine, NaProTechnology, and the Creighton Model FertilityCare System. This in-depth conversation explores why so many women struggle to receive accurate diagnoses, effective treatment, and insurance coverage for gynecologic conditions such as endometriosis, PCOS, and unexplained infertility.\n\nDr. Whitaker explains how conventional women’s healthcare is largely built around symptom suppression, organ removal, and pharmaceutical interventions rather than restoring normal physiology. Together, Lisa and Dr. Whitaker unpack the systemic barriers within medical education, insurance reimbursement, and research design that limit access to restorative care. The episode highlights how cycle charting, fertility awareness, and targeted surgery can dramatically improve health outcomes, fertility potential, and quality of life—often rivaling or outperforming IVF when underlying issues are properly treated.\nKey Topics Covered:\nRestorative reproductive medicine and NaProTechnology\nThe Creighton Model FertilityCare System\nWhy is ovulation misunderstood in conventional medicine?\nMedical training gaps around the menstrual cycle\nInsurance barriers and poor reimbursement for women’s surgeries\nEndometriosis myths, diagnosis, and excision surgery\nWhy is hysterectomy often promoted despite poor outcomes?\nInfertility as a symptom of an underlying disease\nComparing IVF, IUI, and restorative treatment outcomes\nMale factor fertility and overlooked diagnostic opportunities\nEmpowerment, advocacy, and cycle charting as a foundation of care\nListener Takeaways:\nThe menstrual cycle is a vital sign that offers critical diagnostic insight\nOvulation is a marker of health, not a problem to suppress\nEndometriosis is a surgical disease that requires proper excision\nInsurance structures often penalize high-quality women’s care\nRestorative surgery can improve pain, fertility, and quality of life\nIVF success rates are often overestimated and poorly contextualized\nMale fertility is frequently ignored despite clear diagnostic signals\nCycle charting empowers women to advocate for better care\nTrue informed consent requires understanding all available options\nKey Moments (Timestamps & Detailed Summaries)\nEpisode Introduction & Guest Background ( 00:00 – 05:30 )\nLisa introduces Dr. Naomi Whitaker and frames the episode around frustrations many women experience with conventional medicine, fertility treatment, and surgical care access.\nDr. Whitaker’s Path into Restorative Medicine ( 05:30 – 12:00 )\nDr. Whitaker shares her personal journey into medicine, how cycle charting changed her perspective during medical school, and why NaProTechnology reshaped her career.\nWhat Medical School Teaches About Women’s Health ( 12:00 – 18:00 )\nThe discussion reveals how ovulation is often framed as a risk rather than a vital function, and how suppression becomes the default approach in standard medical training.\nWhat Is Restorative Reproductive Medicine? ( 18:00 – 25:00 )\nDr. Whitaker explains NaProTechnology, the Creighton Model, and how fertility awareness biomarkers guide targeted testing and treatment.\nUsing the Menstrual Cycle as a Diagnostic Tool ( 25:00 – 33:00 )\nLisa and Dr. Whitaker discuss how cycle charts reveal inflammation, hormonal imbalance, PCOS, luteal phase defects, and early signs of endometriosis.\nInsurance, Surgery, and Systemic Barriers ( 33:00 – 40:00 )\nDr. Whitaker explains how women’s surgeries—especially endometriosis excision—are poorly reimbursed, forcing many skilled surgeons into cash-pay models.\nEndometriosis Myths & Mismanagement ( 40:00 – 46:00 )\nThe conversation addresses common myths, including hysterectomy as treatment, pain as the only symptom, and the false idea of “asymptomatic” endometriosis.\nInfertility, IVF, and Alternative Outcomes ( 46:00 – 50:00 )\nDr. Whitaker challenges assumptions about IVF success rates, discusses selective tubal procedures, and explains why treating root causes often yields better outcomes.\nAdvocacy, Empowerment & Final Thoughts ( 50:00 – 53:00 )\nThe episode concludes with practical guidance on cycle charting, self-education, finding curious providers, and building grassroots advocacy for better women’s healthcare.\nTRANSCRIPT\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources mentioned\nCreighton Model FertilityCare System\nNaProTechnology\nThree-Tier Endometriosis Symptom Self-Surveyy\nReal Food for Fertility | Lisa Hendrickson-Jack and Lily Nichols\nThe Fifth Vital Sign: Master Your Cycles & Optimize Your Fertility (Book) | Lisa Hendrickson-Jack\nFertility Awareness Mastery Charting Workbook\nFertility Awareness Mastery Online Self-Study Program\nRelated podcasts & blog posts:\nFFP 573 | Is A New Male Contraceptive On The Horizon? | FAMM Research Series\nFFP 560 | Missing Period? | Low Fat Intake And Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (HA) | FAMM Research Series\nFFP 514 | That One Doctor | How Long Does It Take For An Endometriosis Diagnosis? | FAMM Research Series | Lisa | Fertility Friday\nFFP 496 | Diagnosing & Treating Endometriosis | Jenneh Rishe\nFFP 495 | Surgical Treatment & Diagnosis for Endometriosis | Dr. Ken Sinervo\nA Special Thank You to Our Show Sponsors:\nFertility Awareness Mastery Mentorship Program (FAMM)\nThis episode is sponsored by FAMM!

She is a Maya Abdominal Practitioner and soon to be Fertility Awareness Educator. Emmy also works as a surgical technologist and gets the unique perspective of seeing the inner workings of the body, literally. This unique perspective has let her see things like adhesions, fibroids, misaligned uteruses, and so much more. It has made her even more passionate about Maya Abdominal Therapy and FAM, in hopes to help women seek other options before deciding to take the surgical route.
