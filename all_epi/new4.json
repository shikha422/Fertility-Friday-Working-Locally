A new book about the injectable contraceptive first released in July 2017. Together with Dr. Poppy Daniels, the collaboration resulted in an easy to read, an incredibly informative book about the extremely problematic contraceptive, known as the “depo shot.” Traci is also the Founder of depotruth.ca (@depotruth) an online resource for women to learn about the injectable contraceptive. Traci took Depo in 2010 and is still struggling with the effects to this day which is exactly why she’s so passionate about raising awareness and helping those negatively affected know that they are not alone.\nIn today’s interview, we’re talking about the side effects of Depo. Whether you’re considering Depo or currently taking it you’ll want to know what to watch for, and we cover the most common side effects in today’s episode.\nToday’s episode is sponsored by my 10 Week Fertility Awareness Mastery Group Program.

If you haven’t heard of Cora tampons before, Cora is a brand committed to providing healthy, modern menstrual products (i.e. tampons) in a completely new way.\nAfter travelling the world through many developing nations Molly saw how menstruation negatively affects girls and women living in low resource settings. Many of these girls are unable to afford menstrual products and have to resort to using old rags, newspaper, tree bark, and even pieces of old mattresses to manage their monthly bleeds. As you can imagine, using unhygienic methods such as these can cause infections, reproductive health problems, not to mention leaking. When Molly later learned that many of the menstrual products widely sold in North America use harmful chemicals and materials (i.e. pesticides, and other synthetic chemicals) that can cause endocrine disruption, cancer and other illnesses she decided to take matters into her own hands. Molly joined forces with her business partner Morgen and founded Cora.\nNot only are Cora tampons made from premium organic cotton (and free from harmful pesticides & synthetic materials), but Cora’s is on a mission to empower girls in developing nations. For every product sold, Cora provides sustainable menstrual products to girls in low resource settings.\nIn today’s episode, we expose the dangers of using conventional menstrual products, and we also have a much-needed discussion of the challenges that girls and women face in low resource settings.

Kelly is a member of my most recent Fertility Friday Group Program. She recently came off hormonal contraceptives and joined the group in preparation for pregnancy. Although Kelly isn’t actively trying to conceive at the moment, she joined the group as a way to better understand her cycles and focus on improving her menstrual cycle health before she starts trying to conceive later on this year.\nOne of the themes that arise in this episode is the importance of self-advocacy. Kelly recently received a diagnosis of Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis as a result of our sessions together during the group program. In light of her new diagnosis, she has been making a number of changes to her diet and lifestyle to address this, and she is also working closely with a functional practitioner who is supervising her care. With that being said, in Kelly’s case, this issue was only identified because she requested testing.

Amy shares what she has discovered so far. She used the pill for the past 10 years, and although she didn’t really experience any side effects, now that she’s off the hormones she’s since realized how it was affecting her.\nOne of the key takeaways that Amy shares in this episode are how coming off the pill has reunited her with her sex drive. She had chalked up her lack of interest in sex to a personality trait, but since coming off the pill it is clear the pill was at fault for suppressing her sex drive.\nWe also spend some time talking about what’s normal after coming off hormonal contraceptives, especially when you’re wanting to jump in and transition to using fertility awareness for birth control.\nIn this episode, I pull back the curtain and show you inside a real client session, and you get to see exactly what it’s like to work with me one-on-one!\nThere is still time for you to apply to join my April 2017 Group Programs!

Leda is one of my current clients, and she wanted to be part of the series to share her experience learning fertility awareness to use as hormone free birth control.\nOne of the key takeaways that Leda shares in this episode how she has learned to interpret her fertility on a day to day basis instead of using past charts to predict her fertility. Leda’s experience is also unique, because she somehow managed to escape hormonal contraceptive use altogether, and has what I lovingly refer to as “virgin cycles”.\nIn this episode, I pull back the curtain and show you inside a real client session, and you get to see exactly what it’s like to work with me one-on-one!\nThere is still time for you to apply to join my April 2017 Group Programs!

Bowthorpe, M.Ed, has spent years as one of the most well-known and heartfelt Thyroid Patient Advocates, fighting for better thyroid care. And what has made her different from others who claim the same title?  It’s her unique focus, which has always been about reported patient experiences and the wisdom gained from those experiences … rather than strong opinions or courting the medical establishment.\nLike millions worldwide, Janie was a 20-year victim of poor treatment with T4-only meds and the use of the TSH lab test, only to have a miraculous turnaround in the use of Natural Desiccated Thyroid. Those experiences propelled her to represent patients worldwide, totally based on their experiences and wisdom. She is the author of the book, Stop the Thyroid Madness.\nIn today’s show, we talk about why women who show signs of hypothyroidism often have the hardest time getting support from their doctors; whether it’s lab work or getting prescriptions for thyroid medication (other than Synthroid®). We get to the bottom of the common issue of why a woman can feel terrible even if she has “normal” lab results, and what she can do if her doctor isn’t supporting her mission to get to the underlying cause.\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nTopics discussed in today’s episode\nWhat events led to Janie writing her book, Stop the Thyroid Madness?\nJanie talks about the common symptoms of continued Hypothyroidism\nWhy the typical tests doctors run Hypothyroidism are not good enough\nWhy the common treatments for Hypothyroidism don’t usually work\nHow free T3 and T4 levels are better indicators of your thyroid health\nJanie’s advice about how to handle resistance from physicians with regards to testing\nWhy the commonly prescribed medication, Synthroid®, doesn’t always help\nWhat desiccated thyroid is and how it compares to Synthroid®\nWhat can cause symptoms to get worse after taking desiccated thyroid?\nWhat are some underlying causes of Hypothyroidism and can it be cured?\nJanie’s advice for people who’ve had trouble finding a doctor who’ll truly work with them\nThe one thing Janie wants listeners to know\nThe one myth about Hypothyroidism Janie wants to address\nConnect with Janie\nYou can connect with Janie on her Website and on Facebook\nResources mentioned\nStop the Thyroid Madness Website\nStop the Thyroid Madness eBooks\nStop the Thyroid Madness: Lab Values\nStop the Thyroid Madness: Recommended Lab Work\nStop the Thyroid Madness: Natural Thyroid 101\nStop the Thyroid Madness Facebook Page\nFFP 104 | Birth Control Pills From Your Doctor’s Perspective | Why Your Physician isn’t Looking at the Root Cause | Alternative Medicine for Women | Dr. Miranda Naylor\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nJoin the community!
