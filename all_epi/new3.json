She is recognized as a leading expert in Post-Birth Control Syndrome and the long-term side effects associated with hormonal contraceptives. Dr. Brighten is the author of Beyond the Pill, a 30 day plan to support women on birth control, help them transition off, and eliminate symptoms of post-birth control syndrome. She is a speaker, women’s health advocate and a medical advisor for one of the first data-driven apps to offer women personalized birth control recommendations.\nIn today’s episode we talk about the problem with using the pill as the “cure-all” for all things menstrual (since the pill does not cure or fix anything), and the complexities of questioning the pill as a feminist.\nToday’s episode is also sponsored by The Fifth Vital Sign: Master Your Cycles & Optimize Your Fertility.
