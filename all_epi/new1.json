In this episode, Lisa breaks down how ovulation predictor strips work by explaining the role of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the ovulatory process, what a “positive” test is really detecting, and why a positive result doesn’t automatically confirm that ovulation has occurred.\nLisa also walks through the practical pros and limitations of OPKs, including situations where they may be helpful for timing and awareness, and situations where they can be misleading due to hormone thresholds or elevated LH for reasons unrelated to ovulation. Finally, she shares what she considers the most reliable way to identify the fertile window when trying to conceive — and how to use OPKs strategically alongside other fertility awareness signs for a clearer picture of what’s happening in your cycle.\nKey Topics Covered: Understanding Ovulation Tests and Fertile Window Timing\nWhat ovulation predictor strips are designed to measure in the menstrual cycle\nThe role of luteinizing hormone (LH) in triggering ovulation\nWhy a positive ovulation test does not confirm that ovulation has occurred\nCommon reasons ovulation predictor strips may give misleading results\nSituations where ovulation tests may be helpful when trying to conceive\nLimitations of relying on ovulation predictor strips alone\nHow fertility awareness signs provide clearer insight into the fertile window\nListener Takeaways for Identifying the Fertile Window\nOvulation predictor strips measure a hormonal signal, not ovulation itself.\nA positive ovulation test does not guarantee that ovulation will occur.\nHormone levels and individual cycle patterns can affect ovulation test results.\nRelying on ovulation predictor strips alone may lead to missed or mistimed fertile days.\nCombining ovulation tests with fertility awareness charting provides clearer insight into fertility timing.\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nTimestamped Breakdown: Ovulation Strips and Cycle Timing\nWhat do ovulation predictor strips actually measure?

( 10:12 – 14:20 )\nLisa shares how to use ovulation strips as a secondary sign alongside cervical mucus, why relying on strips alone can lead to missed fertile days, and how combining signs provides a clearer picture.\nWhen can ovulation predictor strips be especially helpful? ( 15:37 – 17:29 )\nLisa discusses specific situations where ovulation predictor strips may be beneficial, including cycles using frozen sperm or donor insemination, where timing closer to ovulation is more critical.\nAre ovulation predictor strips necessary for most cycles?

She also serves as an Adjunct Associate Professor at Georgetown, Duquesne University and the University of Utah. Dr. Duane cares for patients via a direct primary care house-calls-based practice, MD for Life. She has served on the board of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the Family Medicine Education Consortium (FMEC). Dr. Duane trained as a Creighton, FEMM and NeoFertility Medical consultant, and a TeenSTAR educator. She received her M.D. degree from the State University of New York at Stony Brook and completed her Family Medicine residency at Lancaster General Hospital in Pennsylvania. She received a Bachelor of Science with Honours and a Master of Health Administration degree from Cornell University. In 2022, Dr. Duane completed a primary care research fellowship at the University of Utah, earning a Master of Science in Public Health.\nEpisode Summary: Integrating Fertility Awareness Into Modern Medicine\nIn this episode, Lisa Hendrickson-Jack is joined by Dr. Marguerite Duane, MD, to explore restorative reproductive medicine and how fertility awareness can be integrated into conventional medical care. Dr. Duane shares what led her to co-found FACTS about Fertility and why educating physicians on fertility awareness–based methods is essential for improving women’s health outcomes. The conversation examines how cycle charting functions as a clinical tool within restorative medicine and why it remains largely absent from standard medical education. Together, they discuss how physicians are trained to approach reproductive health concerns, including the role of NaProTechnology and other restorative approaches. This episode offers insight into how fertility awareness and allopathic medicine can work together to better support menstrual and reproductive health.\nKey Topics Covered: Restorative Reproductive Medicine and Fertility Awareness\nWhat restorative reproductive medicine is and how it differs from conventional approaches\nHow fertility awareness cycle charting functions as a diagnostic tool in medical practice\nWhy fertility awareness–based methods are rarely taught in medical school\nThe role of FACTS about Fertility in physician education and clinical training\nHow physicians are trained to respond to menstrual and reproductive health concerns\nAn overview of NaProTechnology and other restorative approaches to care\nHow patients can find physicians trained in fertility awareness and restorative medicine\nListener Takeaways About Cycle-Based Medicine\nRestorative reproductive medicine uses fertility awareness charting to help identify underlying causes of menstrual and reproductive concerns.\nFertility awareness–based methods can function as clinical tools, not just family planning options.\nMost physicians receive limited training in fertility awareness and root-cause approaches during medical school.\nEducating medical professionals about cycle charting can expand the options available to patients.\nFinding supportive care often means seeking out practitioners specifically trained in fertility awareness and restorative approaches.\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nTimestamped Breakdown: Cycle Charting in Clinical Practice\nWhy aren’t most doctors trained to interpret fertility awareness charts? ( 00:55 – 01:56 )\nLisa introduces the core problem many listeners face: most physicians aren’t trained to use fertility awareness–based methods clinically, and she previews how this episode addresses that gap.\nHow did Dr. Duane discover fertility awareness and why did she start FACTS? ( 02:03 – 07:55 )\nDr. Duane shares how she first learned about cycle charting during residency, why she was frustrated it wasn’t taught in medical school, and what led her to create FACTS about Fertility to educate medical professionals.\nHow are physicians trained to approach women’s reproductive health concerns? ( 08:33 – 14:39 )\nShe explains how medical training is often disease- and treatment-focused, with limited emphasis on nutrition, lifestyle, and using ovulation as a marker of health—leading many clinicians to default to hormonal suppression for symptoms.\nWhat does it mean that women deserve “real reproductive healthcare”? ( 14:45 – 19:26 )\nDr. Duane discusses why cycle biomarkers can reveal underlying abnormalities and uses endometriosis as an example of how symptoms can be minimized instead of properly diagnosed and treated.\nWhat is NaProTechnology and how does it fit into restorative care? ( 19:32 – 21:30 )\nShe defines NaProTechnology and explains how medical protocols use cycle charts to guide targeted testing and individualized treatment aimed at restoring reproductive function.\nHow do NaProTechnology, FEMM, and NeoFertility compare in practice? ( 21:30 – 24:53 )\nDr. Duane outlines the three restorative reproductive medicine approaches and explains why training across multiple protocols can support more comprehensive clinical care.\nWhy does conventional care often focus on symptom control instead of root-cause diagnosis? ( 25:52 – 29:42 )\nLisa and Dr. Duane contrast acute care vs chronic reproductive concerns and explain why women are often offered medications to suppress symptoms without investigation of underlying causes.\nHow do doctors end up learning fertility awareness–based methods after training? ( 29:49 – 35:09 )\nDr. Duane explains that most physicians never learn FABMs in medical school, shares how FACTS trains students and clinicians, and offers ways listeners can “share the facts” with their providers.\nWhat is an ovarian wedge resection and why might it matter for PCOS? ( 37:53 – 42:08 )\nDr. Duane describes ovarian wedge resection as a minimally invasive surgical option that can help restore ovulation in some PCOS cases, and discusses why it’s less commonly offered today.\nHow can you find and vet clinicians trained in restorative reproductive medicine? ( 42:51 – 45:24 )\nShe shares practical steps for locating trained providers, questions to ask your doctor about charting and cycle health, and how to use FACTS and method-specific directories as starting points.\nHow can you advocate for cycle literacy while keeping the focus on science?

This conversation offers clarity for anyone seeking a realistic, grounded understanding of what it takes to use fertility awareness confidently and effectively.\nListener Takeaways for Understanding Fertility Awareness for Birth Control\nFertility awareness requires a solid grasp of charting rules to be effective.\nUnintended pregnancies are often linked to user error, not method failure.\n“Rhythm method thinking” can lead to inaccurate assumptions about ovulation timing.\nCharting focuses on real-time data, not predicting future cycles.\nMany people navigate birth control with nuanced feelings about pregnancy—not always a clear yes or no.\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nTimestamped Breakdown: Using Fertility Awareness for Birth Control\nWhat is fertility awareness and how does it differ from other birth control methods?
