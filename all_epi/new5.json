She is well known for developing a concept of GAPS (Gut And Psychology Syndrome), which she describes in her book Gut And Psychology Syndrome – Natural Treatment for Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Depression, and Schizophrenia.\nThe GAPS diet was developed to naturally treat chronic inflammatory conditions in the digestive tract as a result of a damaged gut lining.  Through years of research and clinical experience, Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride adjusted her protocol to fit the needs of her patients suffering from a variety of intestinal and neurological conditions as a result of an imbalanced bacterial ecosystem within the GI tract.  The GAPS Diet focuses on removing foods that are difficult to digest and damaging to gut flora and replacing them with nutrient-dense foods to give the intestinal lining a chance to heal and seal.\nIn my interview with Dr. Natasha, we talk about the importance of gut health for fertility, pregnancy as well as the important role that gut health plays in the health of your children!\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nTopics discussed in today’s episode\nWhat is the connection between the hormonal health and gut health?\nThe relationship between menstrual cycle irregularities and gut dysbiosis\nHow do antibiotics impact gut flora?\nWhat impact do hormonal contraceptives have on gut flora?\nThe role that breastfeeding and vaginal delivery play in the development of healthy gut flora\nThe relationship between abnormal gut flora and illnesses such as Autism, ADHD, allergies, food sensitivities, eczema, asthma, etc.\nThe relationship between miscarriage and the toxic load we acquire in our modern world\nThe relationship between gut health and fertility\nUsing the GAPS diet to heal and seal the gut wall and improve fertility\nNutrition for fertility, preconception, and pregnancy\nThe importance of cholesterol for fertility and pregnancy and hormone balance\nThe difference between raw dairy products and pasteurized supermarket dairy products\nThe role of fermented foods in the GAPS healing protocol\nWhy is it important for both the mother and father to focus on their gut health when trying to conceive\nThe relationship between gut health and acne\nConnect with Dr. Natasha\nYou can connect with Dr. Natasha on her website! and the GAPS diet website!\nResources mentioned\nDr. Natasha | Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride\nGAPS Diet | Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride\nGut And Psychology Syndrome – Natural Treatment for Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Depression, and Schizophrenia (book) | Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nJoin the community!

Does it “mimic pregnancy”?\nWhat are the 3 fertile signs and how do they indicate fertility?\nWhat does cervical mucus have to do with fertility?\nHow come you can’t use basal body temperature measurements to predict when you’ll ovulate?\nConnect with Lisa\nYou can connect with Lisa on the Fertility Friday website, and on Facebook and Twitter!\nResources mentioned\nFertility Friday\nManaging your Fertility Naturally with Fertility Awareness | Darou Wellness\nJustisse Healthworks for Women | Geraldine Matus\nTaking Charge of Your Fertility | Toni Weschler \nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nJoin the community!

She was a Columnist for Troy Health Media, and she is the new editor-in-chief for Re: Cycling, the blog of the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research. As many of you know, I recently interviewed Holly-Grigg Spall, and in that interview, we spoke about her book Sweetening the Pill or how we got hooked on hormonal birth control. Laura actually wrote the forward to this book, and she has also publicly shown her support for the upcoming documentary that Ricki Lake and Abby Epstein are doing based on the book.

For reference, here is an image of the hormonal cycle during a healthy menstrual cycle.

She has an extensive background in Sexual Assault Awareness and Education through her work as a Public Educator and as the Director of Volunteer Services at the Sexual Assault Centre of Edmonton. She has her Master’s in Counselling Psychology and is currently working on her Ph.D. at the University of Alberta.\nIn today’s show, Erin and I define what Sexual Assault is, we discuss the issue of consent and how consent is defined in the Criminal Code of Canada, and we also discuss some of the most common and prevalent myths about sexual assault that permeate our culture. The purpose of today’s episode is to provide a detailed background and thorough understanding of what behaviors and activities actually fall under the definition of sexual assault. We have an in-depth discussion about the most common myths about sexual assault and how these myths negatively impact survivors of sexual assault. We also discuss the issue of prevention “tips” and how the tips commonly directed towards women to prevent themselves from being assaulted provide a false sense of security and don’t actually address the broader reality of the pervasiveness of sexual abuse in our culture.

Lily also outlines what exercises work best for women during different stages of pregnancy, and dispels many common myths about the level of exercise that is best for pregnancy.

If you haven’t heard of Kindara, it is one of the most user-friendly fertility awareness charting apps available. I started charting my cycles before the age of charting apps and I have found Kindara to be one of the best fertility awareness friendly charting apps out there. I love that the “predictor setting” is optional and that the user-friendly interface allows me to track all of my fertility signs easily. I also love that using the Kindara app links you to a community of women where you can share your charts and support each other.\nWill study mechanical engineering and economics at McGill University, and when he learned about fertility awareness charting he discovered the magic of the feminine, and came to appreciate and understand women on a much deeper level. He appreciates how this level of understanding is lacking in our culture and has been working to improve the ability of women to understand and track their fertility by creating the Kindara Charting app.\nIn today’s episode, we talk about the different ways that fertility awareness charting can help women to discover and appreciate their own fertility and the amazing ways that our bodies work. We also talk about the impact that fertility awareness charting can have on your relationship. Fertility awareness charting offers couples the opportunity to share the responsibility when it comes to contraception, and that is something that is often lacking in many of the commonly used contraceptive methods such as hormonal contraceptives or condoms. We talk about how using fertility awareness charting can increase openness and closeness between partners as well as allow both partners the opportunity to develop not only an increased understanding but also a deep appreciation and reverence for women and their fertility cycles.\nTopics discussed in today’s episode\nThe positive impact that using the fertility awareness method can have on couples who use it\nThe role that the fertility awareness method can play in creating equality between men and women, and put an end to misogyny\nWhat are the benefits of learning fertility awareness?\nHaving “the talk” with your partner about birth control options\nFertility awareness from a man’s perspective\nWill talk about his appearance on The Doctor’s and how frustrating it is that medical practitioners often continue to have such limited knowledge of fertility awareness-based methods of birth control\nHow the Kindara app different from other “period tracker apps”\nWhy the Kindara app works so well for women who are using fertility awareness\nWhat is on the horizon for Kindara?\nWhy the new Wink thermometer technology is such a great innovation for women who use the fertility awareness method\nWhy everyone should be learning the basics of fertility and the menstrual cycle\nTips for transitioning to fertility awareness after coming off of hormonal contraceptives\nConnect with Will!\nYou can connect with Will on the Kindara website, his website, and on Facebook and Twitter!\nResources mentioned\nKindara | Will Sacks\nWill Sacks | Focus Create\nTaking Charge of Your Fertility | Toni Weschler\nThe Garden of Fertility | Katie Singer\nSweetening the Pill: or How We Got Hooked on Hormonal Birth Control | Holly Grigg-Spall \nSweetening the Pill | Holly Grigg Spall\nSweetening the Pill Movie\nThe Optimized Woman: If You Want to Get Ahead Get a Cycle | Miranda Gray\nOptimized Woman | Miranda Gray\nIf Men Could Menstruate | Gloria Steinem\nFertility Appreciation Collaborative to Teach the Systems | FACTS | Dr. Marguerite Duane\nFFP 007 | What the pill really does to your hormones | PCOS & Menstrual Irregularities | Dr. Lara Briden\nFFP 021 | What Hormonal Contraceptives Really do to Women | Sweetening the Pill | Holly Grigg-Spall\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download | Embed\nSubscribe: Apple Podcasts | RSS\nMusic Credit: Intro/Outro music Produced by Sirc of (The Nock)\nShare this:\nLisa Hendrickson is a certified fertility awareness educator and holistic reproductive health practitioner with over 20 years of experience.
